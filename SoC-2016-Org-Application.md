## Short Description (180 chars max)

Git is the most widely-used revision control system in Open Source. It
is a distributed system with an emphasis on speed, data integrity, and
support for many workflows.

## Long Description

Git is the most widely-used revision control system in Open Source. It
is a distributed system with an emphasis on speed, data integrity, and
support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

Many large and successful projects use Git, including the Linux
Kernel, Perl, Eclipse, Gnome, KDE, Qt, Ruby on Rails, Android,
PostgreSQL, Debian, and X.org.

This organization covers projects for
[Git](https://github.com/git/git) itself. Students may also propose
projects related to [libgit2](http://libgit2.github.io/). Other
git-based software or services are not covered by this organization.

## Application Instructions

```
Guidance for students on how to apply to your organization. Should
include any prerequisites or requirements. You may wish to include a
template or tips for their proposals. May include limited Markdown.
```

Please read the "About applying for SoC with the Git project" section
in the ideas page: http://git.github.io/SoC-2016-Ideas/

The primary way to contact the Git community is through the Git
mailing list git@vger.kernel.org. Please discuss your application on
this list.

## Proposal Tags

```
Enter tags that students can select (one) from and apply to their own
proposals to help organize them. Examples: New Feature, Optimization.
You can also use these to designate "sub-organizations" if you are an
umbrella organization.
```

new feature, refactoring, libgit2

## IRC Channel, Mailing List, or Email

Most of the development takes place on the git@vger.kernel.org
mailing-list. See <http://vger.kernel.org/vger-lists.html#git> for
instructions.

There is also an IRC channel: <http://git-scm.com/community>.

# 2016 Application Form

## Why does your org want to participate in Google Summer of Code?

With the exception of 2013, Git has participated in GSoC every year
since 2007. We have appreciated not only the code contributions (both
new features and internal refactoring to reduce the maintenance effort), but
also the increased project visibility and the addition of new long-term
contributors. We also believe strongly in helping students become
comfortable contributing to open source in general, even if they do not
remain involved with Git itself.

## How many potential mentors have agreed to mentor this year?

dropdown list => 1-5.

Text below unused:

```
We have 5 potential mentors this year. This is a smaller number than in
previous years, and we expect to take a correspondingly smaller number
of projects (probably only 2).

All mentors are volunteers for the specific projects that they can
contribute the most to (i.e., ones that meet their interests and
abilities). All mentors are active contributors within the Git
development community, and well-known to the project leadership.

Active contributors are defined to be those who have submitted and have
had accepted into a shipped release a substantial amount of code, where
substantial is defined to be equal to or larger than what might be
expected of a student working on a Google Summer of Code project.
```

## How will you keep mentors engaged with their students?

```
1000 characters.
```

We think that the most important part of GSoC is integrating the
student into the normal communication channels used by other project
members. The first step in dealing with disappearing students is to
make sure they are engaging with the community on design and code
issues, and reaching small milestones on the way to the project. Then
if they do disappear, we know quickly and can react, rather than being
surprised at the end.

If they do disappear, we'll obviously contact them and find out
what's going on. But ultimately, non-communication is grounds for a
failing evaluation, regardless of any code produced.

We plan to take fewer projects than we have as mentors. We usually
have two co-mentors per students, so that one mentor being unavailable
would have a limited impact on the project. Most of our projects can
be mentored by any of the mentors, and by keeping student progress
public and reviewed on-list, another mentor (or the community at
large) can pick up the slack if needed.

## How will you help your students stay on schedule to complete their projects?

```
1000 characters.
```

There are several ways to do this, and they have been successful in
the past:

* Prepare students to submit patches before they started. We use a
  microproject system prior to the student application where students
  must submit at least a patch, and respond to reviews. This means
  that on day 1 of their project, students already know how long
  review cycles are, and how important it is to work with the
  mailing-list.

* Split the work into small patch series. We don't expect regular
  developers to go silent for 3 months and then dump 10,000 lines of
  code on us to review, and we don't want students to do that to us
  either. Even if the first patch series are only preparatory steps
  that do not bring a real added value to Git, it is important to get
  them merged as early as possible. Even if the project is not
  "completed", useful pieces of code are validated all along the
  project.

## How will you get your students involved in your community during GSoC?

```
1000 characters.
```

Students will be required to join the main development mailing list
and post their patches for discussion (in addition to posting their
work as a Git repository on a publicly available server). All current
contributors already do this, so students will be able to see
experienced hands performing the same tasks and learn by example. We
also feel that the list-based discussions will help the student to
become and stay a member of the community.

Mentors will also exchange direct email with students on at least a
weekly basis. Students will be required to provide weekly progress
reports back to their mentors, so that mentors are aware of the
current difficulties. Progress reports give the mentors a chance to
provide suggestions for problem resolution back to the student.

Frequent email and IRC interaction with mentors and other developers
will be strongly encouraged by suggesting students post their questions
and ideas to the mailing list, and to discuss them on #git.

```
Unused text (did not fit the characters limit):


The traffic on the list is focused around Git development. We
expect the students to stay current by at least skimming the messages,
and participating in discussions that are close to their area of work.

Many developers either already hold "office-hours" on IRC, or have
agreed to do so during the GSoC period.
```

## How will you keep students involved with your community after GSoC?

Ultimately we have no leverage over the students after they leave, so
the best we can do is to help them form habits of interaction that they
might find rewarding and want to continue with. We specifically don't
want to give the student a "half project" that needs more work after the
GSoC period is done. That's not fair to the student, nor to the project.

Instead, we'd prefer to get the student involved in the day-to-day of
interacting on the mailing list, reviewing code, and commenting on other
people's ideas and problems. Those are things they can continue to do
after GSoC ends, and those discussions can often spur more coding.

## Has your org been accepted as a mentoring org in Google Summer of Code before?

```

Here is a summary of our projects per year, along with the number of
retained contributors (where "retained" means "still participating on
the mailing list a year or more after their GSoC"):

 - 2007: 2 pass, 1 fail, 1 retained
 - 2008: 4 pass, 2 fail, 3 retained
 - 2009: 1 pass, 1 fail, 0 retained
 - 2010: 3 pass, 1 fail, 3 retained
 - 2011: 5 pass, 0 fail, 4 retained
 - 2012: 3 pass, 0 fail, 2 retained
 - 2014: 2 pass, 1 fail, 0 retained
 - 2015: 2 pass, 0 fail, 2 retained

None.

## Are you part of a foundation/umbrella organization?

No

## What year was your project started?

2005

## Anything else we should know (optional)?

We wrote a blog post after last year's GSoC which was not published on
Google's blog, but the text is available here:
https://git.github.io/rev_news/2015/09/09/edition-7/

# Remarks on the current state of the application

The 2015 application had a question "If you chose "veteran" in the
organization profile dropdown, please summarize your involvement and
the successes and challenges of your participation. Please also list
your pass/fail rate for each year." with a very detailed answer.

Question "How will you help your students stay on schedule to complete
their projects?" is new. Proof-reading is particularly appreciated.

I (Matthieu) have written "no" for foundation/umbrella organization,
but I don't know if this would count as "Yes" if we accept libgit2
projects.
