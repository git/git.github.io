# Outreachy May 2016

Git is participating in Round 12 of Outreachy, an internship program to
encourage diversity in Free and Open Source Software projects. You can
find out more about the program at its [homepage](https://www.gnome.org/outreachy/).

This is the landing page for Git's participation in Round 12 of
Outreachy, which will run from May 23, 2016 to August 23, 2016.  Note
that Git is also participating in [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6343374437089280/) during the same
period. Eligible individuals may apply for both programs (see this
[FAQ](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Outreachy?action=show&redirect=OutreachProgramForWomen#Is_Google_Summer_of_Code_right_for_you.3F)
for details).

## How to Apply

The deadline for applying to Outreachy is **March 22** at 7pm UTC.
Before then, you should fill out an
[application](https://wiki.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen#Send_in_an_Application)
and complete a small [coding
project](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Outreachy?action=show&redirect=OutreachProgramForWomen#Make_a_Small_Contribution).
We have a list of
[microprojects](../SoC-2016-Microprojects), but
you may also work with a potential mentor to come up with a contribution
related to your proposed project.

## Project Ideas

You can find a list of project ideas on our [ideas
page](../SoC-2016-Ideas). Note that this just a list of suggested
projects; we are happy to hear proposals for new projects. If you would
like to propose an idea, please make sure to solicit feedback from the
mailing list (see below) and find someone willing to be a mentor for it.

## Getting in Touch

Most git development happens on the mailing list. Details for posting,
subscribing, and reading archives can be found on our [community
page](http://git-scm.com/community).

You can also find people on the #git channel of irc.freenode.net.
