* [Suspected git grep regression in git 2.40.0](https://lore.kernel.org/git/7E83DAA1-F9A9-4151-8D07-D80EA6D59EEA@clumio.com/)

  Stephane Odul reported that running the command

  `git grep -cP '^\w+ = json.load'`

  on some files of a private repo started failing consistently with an
  exit code of -11 in Git v2.40.0 while it worked with previous Git
  versions.

  Bagas Sanjaya replied to Stephane asking him if he could use `git
  bisect` between v2.39.0 and v2.40.0 to see which commit in Git's
  history broke the feature.

  Junio Hamano, the Git maintainer, thought the issue might have been
  created by a recent change in how Git uses the
  [PCRE2 library](https://www.pcre.org/). This change made Git try to
  run PCRE2's JIT (Just In Time) compiler on a sample pattern and fall
  back to not using the JIT compiler if the attempt failed.

  Junio said it could alternatively be that the version of the PCRE2
  library linked to v2.40 had been updated compared to the one in
  previous Git versions, but asked if it made a difference to disable
  the JIT compiler by prefixing the pattern with `(*NO_JIT)`.

  Mathias Krause, who had worked on PCRE2 related issues recently,
  replied that another commit with the subject "grep: correctly
  identify utf-8 characters with \{b,w} in -P" seemed more suspect to
  him as it was about both the `-P` option and the `\w` pattern.

  Looking at the diff of that commit, Mathias found that it added the
  `PCRE2_UCP` flag to the PCRE2 library call when an UTF-8 locale was
  used, and that PCRE2 had a `PCRE2_ERROR_UTF8_ERR9` (-11) error code
  described as "5th-byte's two top bits are not 0x80" that matched
  the exit code of -11 which Stephane got.

  Mathias then asked Stephane if a file in his repo might contain
  invalid UTF-8 output, and suggested testing this using the following
  command:

  ```
  $ iconv -f UTF-8 your_file > /dev/null && echo OK || echo "Not valid"
  ```

  Stephane replied that he created a custom pipeline to try to
  reproduce the issue and found that restricting the `git grep`
  command to Python files (using `'*.py'`) was a good workaround, and
  that the issue was likely related to other files in "various
  formats, including potentially some binaries that would definitely
  not be proper UTF-8". He also noted that using `(*NO_JIT)` as
  suggested by Junio prevented the issue but slowed down the command a
  lot for some patterns.

  Mathias, in the meantime, was able to reproduce the error on the Git
  repo. He got a segfault and also a backtrace under gdb, but the
  backtrace was very short and without any debug symbols, so he
  supposed that it happened in the call stack of PCRE2's JIT
  compiler. Looking at the memory mapping and the instructions also
  seemed to point to a JIT compiler bug.

  Mathias then reverted the commit that added the `PCRE2_UCP` flag to
  the PCRE2 library call, and found that it fixed the bug, which
  confirmed his earlier suspicion about that commit.

  Stephane thanked Mathias for his great work and left saying he was
  happy with the workaround he had found and did not believe there was
  much more he could contribute to the issue.

  Mathias replied to his previous email saying he had found "an
  interesting entry in the PCRE2's changelog for version 10.35":<br/>
  <https://github.com/PCRE2Project/pcre2/blob/pcre2-10.35/ChangeLog#L66>:<br/>
  "17. Fix a crash which occurs when the character type of an invalid UTF
  character is decoded in JIT."

  He concluded that it was needed to implement "yet another quirk to
  handle these broken versions", and came up with an in-email patch
  that was not using the `PCRE2_UCP` flag when Git was compiled to
  link to a PCRE2 version lower than 10.35. He wondered though if it
  was better to just revert the commit that had introduced the
  `PCRE2_UCP` flag.

  Junio replied to Mathias by first thanking him for "all the
  investigation and a prompt fix" and then saying that the approach in
  his patch was more sensible than reverting the commit. He suggested
  a small code change though.

  Mathias agreed with Junio's suggestion and sent
  [a version 2 of his patch](https://lore.kernel.org/git/20230323172539.25230-1-minipli@grsecurity.net/)
  that was then merged into the `master` branch.
