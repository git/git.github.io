+ [[Change] Git build issue on NonStop](https://lore.kernel.org/git/01c101dc2842$38903640$a9b0a2c0$@nexbridge.com/)

  Randall S. Becker reported on the mailing list that CI tests on the
  NonStop x86 platform were broken after the `uintptr_t` type started
  to be used in [clar](https://github.com/clar-test/clar) tests when
  displaying error messages in test failures (in case pointer comparisons
  fail).

  Jeff King, alias Peff, replied to Randall that `uintptr_t` was
  already used in many places in the regular code, and guessed the
  issue might come from how clar defined that type. He noted though
  that the line in the clar test where `uintptr_t` appeared also
  contained `PRIxPTR` which is a macro that is not used in the regular
  code. So he wondered if just replacing that macro with `PRIuMAX`
  (which is often used) would be enough to fix the issue.

  `PRIxPTR`, `PRIuMAX` and similar macros are format specifier macros
  from the C standard library (defined in `<inttypes.h>`) that provide
  portable ways to print integer types using functions like `printf()`
  across different platforms. They are all named in the same way, with
  `PRI` meaning `printf`, the next letter indicating the format, like
  `x` for hexadecimal and `u` for unsigned decimal, and the last part
  indicating the type, like `PTR` for pointer-sized integers, `MAX`
  for maximum-width integers, `64` for 64-bit, etc.

  Randall replied to Peff that replacing `PRIxPTR` with `PRIuMAX`
  would work, and that he was going to try it.

  Patrick Steinhardt also replied to Randall and Peff saying it would
  work, and asked Peff if he wanted to send that change.

  Peff replied to Patrick that he'd be happy if Patrick sent the
  change, but noted that using `PRIxMAX` might be better than
  `PRIuMAX` as the code wanted to print hexadecimal values.

  Patrick then reported to Peff that Peff's suggestion to use the
  `PRIxMAX` or `PRIuMAX` format specifier macros didn't work on 32 bit
  systems, because casting a pointer to an integer of different size
  (the pointer is 32 bits, but `uintmax_t` is 64 bits) fails.

  Patrick proposed using `%p` as a format specifier saying it might be
  a better trade-off. The downside was that the output format would be
  unpredictable across platforms as `%p` doesn't have a standardized
  output format. So tests that validated the exact error message
  format would have to be dropped. But at least `%p` would work
  everywhere and produce stable output.

  Junio Hamano, the Git maintainer, agreed with Patrick that `%p` was
  "the most appropriate solution".

  Randall then confirmed that `%p` worked on NonStop x86 even if the
  man pages warned to the contrary.

  The `%p` solution was eventually merged to the 'master' branch.


## Developer Spotlight: Kristoffer Haugsbakk

* **Who are you and what do you do?**

  I’m Kristoffer from Norway. My day job is working on a Java webapp
  primarily used for clinical mental health questionnaires.

* **What would you name your most important contribution to Git?**

  One I like was when I and the mailing list collaborators fixed a bug
  related to Git notes handling by [git-format-patch(1)][1]. It’s
  small and niche but Git notes handling is very important to me; I
  think Notes are a great way to maintain metadata between patch
  submissions. In fact I think it’s great for most commit metadata
  that I am interested in maintaining.

[1]: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-format-patch

* **What are you doing on the Git project these days, and why?**

  The one I am focusing on is improving the [git-patch-id(1)][2]
  documentation. It so happens that you can use that command to make a
  commit—patch-id mapping for the whole repository, which you then in
  turn can use to make an improved [git-cherry(1)][3] oneliner (one
  that says what the upstream commit hash is) as well as, say, using
  commands like git-range-diff to see if the upstream committer made
  any changes to your submission like fixing commit message typos. But
  most uses of this command that I see just use it to figure out what
  the patch ID of one single commit is and have to script everything
  around that, like loop over [git-rev-list(1)][4].

[2]: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-patch-id
[3]: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry
[4]: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rev-list

* **If you could get a team of expert developers to work full time on
  something in Git for a full year, what would it be?**

  I would ask them to find a way for projects to define their own
  conventions and preferences that can be easily shared with all
  contributors. Something better than asking each contributor to
  download and install hooks. Projects need a better and more
  declarative way to configure how their project is supposed to
  work. One example might be that a project does not want merge
  commits to land in the mainline. It should be simple to take that
  high-level goal and make sure that the in-effect central repository
  never gets any merge commits.

  Git will not be replaced any time soon, despite it being more
  difficult to use than it ought to be. But we can already see what
  the effects of the high difficulty of using it is: some projects
  outsource all commit messages to issue trackers, and change
  proposals (pull requests and patch series descriptions) to webapp
  forges. (Meaning they don’t even duplicate the PR description
  somewhere in Git like in a commit message.)  What you end up with is
  still Git but with all the interesting information living at least
  one hyperlink away.

* **If you could remove something from Git without worrying about
  backwards compatibility, what would it be?**

  I can’t think of a single thing to remove that would have a big
  impact.

  I guess I would remove [git-filter-branch(1)][5]. People can use
  [git-filter-repo(1)][6]. And with that one removed I wouldn’t have to ask
  people to not use it any more. ;)

[5]: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-filter-branch
[6]: https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo

* **Documentation contributions require understanding both the technical
  implementation and the user perspective. How do you approach
  bridging that gap? Do you have strategies for ensuring documentation
  stays accurate as code evolves?**

  Most of the challenge in bridging the gap for me is about trying to
  describe things accurately while not being tedious and verbose. The
  worst challenge is when I realistically have one paragraph to
  explain something but there are eight factors to mention. (Not a
  real case; just the feeling of a challenge that I have encountered
  before.)

  For things that are either just difficult or have many factors to
  consider I think the best approach we have right now is to mention
  other documentation pages in parentheses. An obvious candidate is
  [gitglossary(7)][7] where we can gather all kinds of jargon and be
  as verbose as we want to. :)

  I don’t have any strategies for ensuring that documentation stays
  accurate as code evolves. Let’s take something concrete as an
  example: an update to the documentation adds a very similar
  paragraph to two documentation pages. That is an obvious maintenance
  burden since a later update is likely to necessitate a change in
  both places, but you are likely to only deal with one of them. The
  obvious fix is to parameterize the paragraph. But I don’t have good
  indirect experience with that in [AsciiDoc][8]; the last time I saw
  something parameterized was when an [AsciiDoc][8] macro forced
  inline formatting to be handled literally. The cure seems worse than
  the disease to me.

  The best I can do now when making updates is to investigate the
  lines that I am changing and find the histories of any possible
  near-duplicate texts.

[7]: https://git-scm.com/docs/gitglossary
[8]: https://asciidoc.org/

* **What is your favorite Git-related tool/library, outside of Git
  itself?**

  [Magit][9]. An Emacs Git frontend.

[9]: https://magit.vc/

* **Do you happen to have any memorable experience w.r.t. contributing
  to the Git project? If yes, could you share it with us?**

  When I added a test case to `t/t7001-mv.sh` that [made the continuous
  build routine on Windows (CI) time out][16]. The test was
  `test_expect_failure` and triggered a C assertion, and the Windows
  CI pops up a modal dialog on assertion failures. That dialog is of
  course never dismissed by any operator and so the suite eventually
  timed out.

[16]: https://lore.kernel.org/git/pull.1908.git.1745593515875.gitgitgadget@gmail.com/

* **What is your toolbox for interacting with the mailing list and for
  development of Git?**

  I use the builtin commands for making patches and sending them
  ([git-format-patch(1)][10] and [git-send-email(1)][11]). For programming and
  writing I use the basic, needed tools along with Emacs. Very
  occasionally I will use GDB.

[10]: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-format-patch
[11]: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-send-email

* **What is your advice for people who want to start Git development?
  Where and how should they start?**

  Find something technically wrong in the documentation and fix
  it. That’s what I did in 2016; I wanted to test out this new (to me)
  “email-based workflow”. Focus on fixing things instead of
  subjectively improving something. Because someone might object and
  propose that you send a new version. Making subjective documentation
  improvements is the next step in terms of difficulty I guess.

  It sounds trivial but someone used to Git forges will have enough
  challenges just sending proper patches to the project over email.

  Also read through [`Documentation/SubmittingPatches`][12]. I don’t
  really see many corrections that refer to other documents. You could
  of course get a correction that refers to some [*lore*][13] but that
  is unlikely to happen for simple changes if you just structure it
  similar to recent, accepted submissions that you find.

[12]: https://git-scm.com/docs/SubmittingPatches
[13]: https://lore.kernel.org/git

* **If there's one tip you would like to share with other Git
  developers, what would it be?**

  You won’t get any C programming tips from me since I can’t write or
  edit three lines of C code without segfaulting five times.

  Take advantage of the fact that the Git history is so
  well-structured. Maybe you find some questionable behavior or
  code. Use the “pickaxe” technique (see [git-log(1)][14]) on some
  good candidate text and trace the behavior back to the start. Maybe
  the commit message explains the issue or behavior. If not use
  `refs/notes/amlog` (which you should be “subscribed” to already) and
  see if something relevant was discussed on the patch discussion. If
  not there is likely to be no written record out there; another thing
  that this project is disciplined about is keeping the relevant
  discussion on the mailing list, not the mailing list and N other
  satellite fora.

  Those links (to commits and archived emails) are very valuable when
  you want to discuss a change to something that has been in
  [git(1)][15] for years and years.

  Described in [Build metrics and budgets with git-metrics](https://dev.to/jdrouet/build-metrics-and-budgets-with-git-metrics-4pb4)
  article by Jérémie Drouet on DEV\.to (2024).
    + There is another [git-metrics](https://github.com/Praqma/git-metrics) tool,
      by the Praqma / Eficode DevOps company,
      which consists of a set of scripts to analyse a Git repository for metrics
      such as lead time and open branches.  Written in Python, no license provided.
      It was mentioned in passing in [Git Rev News Edition #48](https://git.github.io/rev_news/2019/02/27/edition-48/).
+ [git-spice](https://abhinav.github.io/git-spice/) is a tool for stacking Git branches.
  It lets you manage and navigate stacks of branches, conveniently modify and rebase them,
  and create GitHub Pull Requests or GitLab Merge Requests from them.
  Written in Go, under GPL 3.0 License.
    + A _stacked branch_ refers to a set of branches that build upon each other in a linear sequence.
      Stacked branches or stacked diffs were first mentioned in [Git Rev News #44](https://git.github.io/rev_news/2018/10/24/edition-44/),
      and most recently in [Git Rev News #127](https://git.github.io/rev_news/2025/09/30/edition-127/),
      where you can find even more links about this technique.
