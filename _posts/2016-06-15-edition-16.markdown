## Git Rev News: Edition 16 (June 15th, 2016)

Welcome to the 16th edition of [Git Rev News](https://git.github.io/rev_news/rev_news/),
a digest of all things Git. For our goals, the archives, the way we work, and how to contribute or to
subscribe, see [the Git Rev News page](https://git.github.io/rev_news/rev_news/) on [git.github.io](https://git.github.io).

This edition covers what happened during the month of May 2016.

## Discussions

### General

* Ensimag students contributing to Git

Attracted by the Open Source world, we, eight French students from
[Grenoble INP - Ensimag](http://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr), are having
their first experience in contributing to an Open Source software by
joining the Git community for a 4-week school project. It was a great
opportunity to participate in a useful non-academic project and to
practice what we’ve learned at school.

To get to know the Git community, we started with simple improvements:
using `-` as a shortcut for `@{-1}` for `git worktree add`, adding CSS
pattern for `git diff ` and using the parser API for `git upload-pack`.
Part of the job was also to start discussions on different subjects:
how to setup a Triangular Workflow, about the consistency of the
documentation and its readability concerning literals...

One of our main work was to implement a feature that allows to easily
reply to a given email with the `git send-email` command: it populates
appropriate header (`To:` / `Cc:` / …) and cites the given message
body. Another one was to add the symmetrical of `git push --set-upstream`
to `git pull`. We also worked on a deny policy to prevent accidental
pushes to unwanted remote using a blacklist/whitelist list
feature. Some of us improved the strbuf API by using stack-allocated
memory instead of heap-allocated to avoid malloc and free.

It was a great experience to face real practical issues when it comes
to developing a software with thousands other developers all around
the world. We’ve learned a lot about rigor and communication which
really were at the center of our work. Maybe we’ll see each other
again on the mailing list since some of us are willing to finish the
patch they were working on and possibly continue the adventure.

We also all wanted to thank Git folks for the time they spent
reviewing our patches and helping us.

But for sure, launching a git command will never feel the same ;-)

* [proposal for extending smudge/clean filters with raw file access](https://public-inbox.org/git/20160512182432.GA27427%40kitenet.net/)

Joey Hess, who is the [git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/)
main developer and maintainer, sent an email with some suggestions to
extend smudge/clean filters.

Smudge/clean filters can be used to automatically perform
transformations on the content when it is checked into Git or out of
it. This can be used for example to perform keyword substitution like
Subversion or CVS allows with keywords named '$Id$', '$Rev$' or
'$Author$'.

The idea is that these filters would call git-annex automatically and
git-annex could decide, when a file is added, if its content should
indeed by handled regularly by the Git repo or if it should be handled
by git-annex. In a similar way when a file is checked out, git-annex
would be called and could get the file content it by itself if it is
managing the file.

Joey's suggestions on the mailing list were the following:

```
I'm using smudge/clean filters in git-annex now, and it's not been an
entirely smooth fit between the interface and what git-annex wants
to do.

...

So I propose extending the filter driver with two more optional
commands. Call them raw-clean and raw-smudge for now.

raw-clean would be like clean, but rather than being fed the whole
content of a large file on stdin, it would be passed the filename, and
can access the file itself. Like the clean filter, it outputs the
cleaned version on stdout.

raw-smudge would be like smudge, but rather than needing to output the
whole content of a large file on stdout, it would be passed a filename,
and can create that file itself.
```

After discussing those new commands with Junio Hamano, the Git
maintainer, it looks like patches to add them could be accepted. The
names "clean-from-fs" and "smudge-to-fs" have been suggested for them.

* [https://public-inbox.org/git/nhlqd4%24ekr%241%40ger.gmane.org/](Odd Difference Between Windows Git and Standard Git)

Jon Forrest sent an email about a `git status` behavior he sees on
Windows, which is different than on Linux on a repository that is
shared between the two environments. On Windows it looks like "every
.pdf file and some .png files are modified".

Torsten Bögershausen, who has been working on Windows compatibility
lately, especially related to line ending, first asked Jon some basic
questions:

```
What does
git diff
say ?

What does
git config -l | grep core
say ?

And what does
git ls-files --eol
say?
```

As Jon answered:

```
old mode 100755
new mode 100644
```

Torsten replied:

```
So the solution is to run
git config core.filemode false
```

Jon replied:

```
This worked perfectly!

I wonder if this should be the default for Git for Windows.
```

To which Torsten replied:

```
It is.
But you need to clone the repo under Windows.

I probably submit a patch some day, that core.filemode will be ignored
under Windows.
```

From further discussions, it appeared that, when cloning a repo or
when using `git init`, we probe to see if the executable bit "sticks"
to the files and we set the 'core.filemode' config variable
accordingly. That works well, but we don't probe at other times, so it
doesn't work well for repos that are shared using a network filesystem
or Dropbox.

To try to fix that, Torsten suggested a patch so that the
'core.filemode' setting is ignored under Windows. The problem with
that, is that dictating "for all eternity that Git for Windows cannot
determine the executable bit" might not be a good long term strategy,
as "who knows for certain?".

Johannes Schindelin, the Git for Windows maintainer, suggested making
the default 'core.filemode' setting platform-dependent. This last
solution is already used for end of line setting. But it doesn't fix
the problem when a repo created on Linux, where 'core.filemode' has
been automatically set to true at init time, is shared.

Another solution would be to probe more often than just when cloning
or using `git init`, but it appears that we don't want to do that for
each command and it is not clear how to easily probe when there might
not even be a '.git' directory.

The conclusion from the thread is that unfortunately it looks like
there is no simple solution to avoid this kind of problems for now.

## Developer Spotlight: Duy Nguyen

* Who are you, and what do you do?

I became a Linux user since 2001 or so when I bought myself a Red Hat
CD to celebrate joining the university. I was a GNOME Vietnamese
translator for about ten years before giving up for lack of free time,
and a Gentoo developer for four or five years (giving up for the same
reason). By day I'm a software developer working mostly in telecom
area.

* What would you name your most important contribution to Git?

It's been 10 years and I don't have very good memory. But I guess I
would name it sparse checkout. It's far from perfect, but I'm working
on that.

* What are you doing on the Git project these days, and why?

I'm still scratching my own itches and trying to push changes back in
git.git so I don't have to maintain them separately. They are "git
worktree move", dealing with the shared $GIT_DIR/config file in
multiple worktrees, diff rename annotation, a builtin version of
diff-highlight script, to name a few. There are some more challenging
work like narrow clone or pack version 4, which is just fun to do.
Though "fun" sometimes translates to "headache".

* If you could get a team of expert developers to work full time on
  something in Git for a full year, what would it be?

I don't know :-) I don't see far ahead in the future of Git because
I'm mostly busy dealing with my own unhappiness with some aspect of
Git. But if I could, maybe rewrite Git from scratch? On a smaller
scale, we still have problems with "big numbers" in Git, may it be the
number of refs, of files in a working tree, of objects to transfer or
the size of an object... We know how to deal with some of these
already and a dedicated expert team could help make it happen much
faster.

* If you could remove something from Git without worrying about
  backwards compatibility, what would it be?

Hmm.. there are lots of things I want to replace if backward
compatibility is thrown out of the window, but removing...no, probably
none.

* What is your favourite Git-related tool/library, outside of Git itself?

None. If it's good and related to Git, I try to integrate it in Git
itself so I don't have extra dependencies :)
