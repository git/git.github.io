### Reviews

+ [[PATCH v2 0/2] Prevent re-reading 4 GiB files on every status](https://lore.kernel.org/git/20231012160930.330618-1-sandals@crustytoothpaste.net/)

  In May 2022 Jason Hatton sent
  [an email to the mailing list](https://lore.kernel.org/git/CY4PR16MB1655A1F7DD8B2FABCC30C9DAAFC39@CY4PR16MB1655.namprd16.prod.outlook.com/)
  about the fact that any file of a size that is an exact multiple
  of 8GiB makes Git extremely slow on the repository.

  He said that he had already opened
  [an issue about this on the Git for Windows issue tracker](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/3833#issuecomment-1116544918)
  where Jason, Philip Oakley, brian m. carlson and Johannes
  Schindelin, alias Dscho, had already discussed the issue.

  Git uses an `uint32_t` type, a 32 bit long unsigned integer, for
  storing the file size in the index. This rolls over if the value is
  greater than 2 to the power 32, so with file sizes over 4GiB. When
  the size is exactly 4GiB or a multiple of it, like 8GiB,
  the rollover makes it zero.

  A zero file size in the index has a special meaning for Git,
  though. It tells Git that the file needs to be hashed again. Hashing
  a file is supposed to reset its file size in the index to a non-zero
  value, but with a 4GiB file size the rollover happens and the file
  size is still zero. So the hashing will be performed again and again
  by many different Git commands, making Git very slow.

  Jason proposed, as a solution to this problem, to detect when the
  rollover would happen, and in that case set the size to 1 instead
  of zero.

  Junio C Hamano, the Git maintainer, replied to Jason confirming the
  issue and explaining it a bit more in detail. Jason and Junio then
  discussed the issue a bit more, while Jason tested locally his
  suggested fix and proposed to send a real patch to fix the issue.

  René Scharfe then chimed into the discussion asking if a value other
  than one would be better and would avoid other possible issues.
  Philip Oakley replied to René suggesting using 0x80000000 instead of
  1 when the rollover is detected. This would make it easier to
  detect "almost all incremental and decremental changes in file
  sizes", as the file size in the index helps detecting file changes.

  Jason and Philip discussed the issue a bit more and agreed that
  using 0x80000000 only for exact multiples of 4GiB would likely be
  the best solution.

  Philip and Carlo Marcelo Arenas Belón also tried to help Jason
  properly submit a patch to the mailing list.

  Jason then sent
  [a patch to the mailing list](https://lore.kernel.org/git/CY4PR16MB16552D74E064638BEC11ECB1AFC59@CY4PR16MB1655.namprd16.prod.outlook.com/)
  with the changes and explanation that had been discussed. Torsten
  Bögershausen, Philip and Junio reviewed it, and suggested some
  improvements. Junio especially requested some tests to be added.

  After some discussions with Jason to clarify what should be
  improved, Jason sent
  [another version of his patch](https://lore.kernel.org/git/20220507185813.1403802-1-jhatton@globalfinishing.com/).

  It looked like Jason found an issue with the patch due to using
  0x80000000 instead of 1. René and Philip discussed it with Jason,
  but there was no clear conclusion. It wasn't even clear if there was
  an issue at all. But anyway the work on this stopped for more than
  one year.

  Fortunately a few weeks ago, brian m. carlson sent
  [a new version of Jason's patch](https://lore.kernel.org/git/20231012160930.330618-1-sandals@crustytoothpaste.net/)
  along with another patch adding tests.

  These patches were reviewed by Eric Sunshine, Jeff King, alias Peff,
  Junio and Jason. After some discussions it appeared that the patches
  were good enough for Junio, so he decided to apply a small change
  and then merge them. This issue is therefore fixed in
  Git 2.43.0 released on November 20th.

## Developer Spotlight: Alexander Shopov

* Who are you and what do you do?

  I am Alexander Shopov - a backend engineer in the Amsterdam office of
  Uber working on money related systems. I am a long time translator of
  FOSS software to Bulgarian - I am coordinating translations of GNOME,
  Translation Project and many GNU modules. Bulgarian is an Eastern
  South Slavic language written in the Cyrillic alphabet.

* What would you name your most important contribution to Git?

  I made and now maintain the Bulgarian translation of the text
  interface of Git, Gitk, and Git Gui.

* What is the typical workflow of a contributor engaged in Git
  translation?

  There are 19 translations of the text interface of Git, and only 13 of
  them are above 80%, so I am not sure about "typical". It is a fairly
  standard workflow for a FOSS project.

  Generally one needs to do the following:

  1. Read the translator-targeted README.md in the po directory
  2. Sync pace with the [calendar of Git releases](https://tinyurl.com/gitcal)
  3. Use the [l10n coordinator repository](https://github.com/git-l10n/git-po)
     maintained by Jiang Xin who makes sure translations get integrated upstream.

  Currently the translation is a bit above 5500 messages, which is about
  40k words, 250k of characters, or about 150 pages of text. It can be
  intimidating for a new translator. But you can definitely make it: be
  patient and translate some messages every release, merge, publish and
  repeat. Even better though harder is getting more than one person
  translating.

* Do you contribute to Git in ways other than providing translation?
  If so, could you elaborate about them?

  Sadly not that much. On rare occasions I improve messages and mark
  strings for translations. Perhaps that will be the way I contribute
  unless I find a mentor and something that I find particularly
  interesting and important for me. So if anyone is willing to mentor
  me, especially in making large repos faster - [ping me](mailto:ash@kambanaria.org).
  I can be a competent tester at least.

* If you could get a team of expert developers to work full time on
  something in Git for a full year, what would it be?

  Due to its enormous success, Git is being used on humongous code bases
  with a crazy number of files, directories, commits and branches.
  Working with repos larger than 10GB can be a bit slow. Improving the
  experience would be a great thing.

* If you could remove something from Git without worrying about
  backwards compatibility, what would it be?

  Backwards compatibility is massively important and I am thankful
  developers and users are all invested in this.

  If we treat this as a hypothetical question, there are 3 things to Git:
  - the command-line interface
  - the wire protocol
  - the storage format

  The command-line interface is gradually being improved. The wire
  protocol is also a place where there are workarounds for versioning.
  The storage format however is another (quite conservative and public)
  API. I would remove the old versions and try to design it targeting
  projects that are 10-100 times larger than the Linux kernel first. In
  for a penny, in for a pound. If we break things, let us break them so
  hard that bards will sing songs about us!

* What is your favorite Git-related tool/library, outside of Git itself?

  I mainly use command line `git` plus `gitk` and `git-gui`. I do like using
  the meld diff tool when I work on translations.

* Do you happen to have any memorable experience w.r.t. contributing
  to the Git project? If yes, could you share it with us?

  The initial getting to 100% translated messages was a challenge. I
  decided that I should translate Git around December 2013. That was
  around 2200 messages at that time and it took me about 3 releases of
  Git to reach 100%. Getting to 100% was immensely hard, rewarding and
  memorable. Afterwards keeping the translation at 100% was much easier.

* Is there something you feel could be done to ease the life of
  translators?

  The terminology glossary of Git is much larger than 7 years ago, and we
  (the translators) should actually update `git://repo.or.cz/git-gui.git::po/glossary`
  and merge it in Git.

* What is your advice for people who want to start Git development?
  Where and how should they start?

  I don't know to be honest. If I knew I may have started already.

* If there's one tip you would like to share with other Git
  developers, what would it be?

  That would be the tip of master two years in the future. On a more
  serious note - perhaps more tools for migration out of the still
  existing proprietary version control systems would be helpful.
