## Git Rev News: Edition 13 (March 16th, 2016)

Welcome to the 13th edition of [Git Rev News](https://git.github.io/rev_news/rev_news/),
a digest of all things Git. For our goals, the archives, the way we work, and how to contribute or to
subscribe, see [the Git Rev News page](https://git.github.io/rev_news/rev_news/) on [git.github.io](https://git.github.io).

This edition covers what happened during the month of February 2016.

## Discussions

### General

* [RFC: Resumable clone based on hybrid "smart" and "dumb" HTTP](https://public-inbox.org/git/CAJo%3DhJtHgE_vye_1sPTDsvJ0X%3DCs72HKLgRH8btpW-pMrDdk9g%40mail.gmail.com/)

It is a widely known problem that `git clone` is not resumable. If the
connection comes down during a clone, the clone has to be restarted
from scratch.

A work around that is often suggested and used is to first create a
bundle using `git bundle`, to rsync that bundle, then to clone from
the rsync'ed bundle and eventually to fetch what is missing from the
remote git repository. Some tools
[like gitolite](https://public-inbox.org/git/CADdDZRmufDTYYxHeAuPbCUn5iQHruAOXXho5KVOQ6McfSFvPJw%40mail.gmail.com/) or
[the "repo" tool that is used by AOSP](https://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html)
and some websites
[like kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org/)
have even been making it easier to support that.

There was also at one point in 2011
[a patch series](https://public-inbox.org/git/20111110074330.GA27925%40sigill.intra.peff.net/)
to improve the support of this kind of clone workflow internally.

And for some time this was thought of by some Git developers as just a
small manpower problem. A few months of dedicated work by anyone could
probably fix that. It was even proposed as a Google Summer of Code
(GSoC) project.

Over time though the community realized that it was not so easy
because some very careful design was needed, and it was removed from
the list of possible GSoC projects.

So it was very exciting to see a number of new proposals pop up on the
list during the last few months.

It started on February 5 with
[a "Resumable clone revisited, proof of concept" patch series by Duy Nguyen](https://public-inbox.org/git/1454662677-15137-1-git-send-email-pclouds%40gmail.com/)
where he wrote:

> I was reminded by LWN about this. Annoyed in fact because it's
> called a bug while it looks more like an elephant.

and pointed to [a LWN.net article](https://lwn.net/Articles/674392/)
that reports about
[Sarah Sharp speaking at the SCALE 14x conference](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/14x/presentations/improving-diversity-maslows-hierarchy-needs):
"she noted that Git still does not support interrupting and resuming
download operations, which is an important bug to fix."

Then on February 10 Shawn Pearce sent
[an 'RFC: Resumable clone based on hybrid "smart" and "dumb" HTTP' proposal](https://public-inbox.org/git/CAJo%3DhJtHgE_vye_1sPTDsvJ0X%3DCs72HKLgRH8btpW-pMrDdk9g%40mail.gmail.com/)
that he had discussed internally with other people at Google where he works.

This was followed on March 2 by
[an email called "Resumable git clone?"](https://public-inbox.org/git/20160302012922.GA17114%40jtriplet-mobl2.jf.intel.com/)
from Josh Triplett, a well known Linux Kernel developer, who asked:

> In a discussion elsewhere, Al Viro suggested taking the partial pack
> received so far, repairing any truncation, indexing the objects it
> contains, and then re-running clone and not having to fetch those
> objects.  This may also require extending receive-pack's protocol for
> determining objects the recipient already has, as the partial pack may
> not have a consistent set of reachable objects.
>
> Before starting down the path of developing patches for this, does the
> approach seem potentially reasonable?

Josh talks about Al Viro who is another well known Linux Kernel
developer, and it's interesting to see Linux Kernel developers
interested again in taking part in Git development. It reminds some
old timers about the "good old time".

All these proposals have been discussed by many regular Git developers
and reviewers like Stefan Beller, Junio Hamano, Johannes Schindelin,
Jonathan Nieder, Eric Sunshine, Jeff King, Elia Pinto.

About Shawn's proposal Blake Burkhart reminded the community that the
implementation has to keep in mind that it would introduce potential
security issue if Shawn's proposal is done carelessly. And other
people like Bhavik Bavishi and Konstantin Ryabitsev also took part in
the discussion following Josh's email.

From the last discussions about Josh's email, it appeared that Git
developers favored Shawn's proposal over others, though Shawn's
proposal could benefit from implementing parts of Al's and Josh's
proposal too. So the plan seemed to be that Shawn's proposal was going
to be worked on soon, and then later some optimizations from Al and
Josh could be implemented on top of it.

Then on March 5 Kevin Wern sent
[an email called "Resumable clone"](https://public-inbox.org/git/CANtyZjSJf5_xbsBC5tUaazFT3uiEgJnx2_kHLwYwKcn50Jy_qg%40mail.gmail.com/),
where he said he began looking at relevant code to start working on it, and he asked:

> Is someone working on this currently?  Are there any things I should
> know moving forward?  Is there a certain way I should break
> down/organize the feature when writing patches?

Duy answered that "Resumable clone is happening." And pointed to
[some preparation work](https://public-inbox.org/git/xmqq1t7r2x21.fsf%40gitster.mtv.corp.google.com/)
by Junio Hamano [going on](https://public-inbox.org/git/xmqqvb556abd.fsf%40gitster.mtv.corp.google.com/).
Junio by the way answered with
[a very long email](https://public-inbox.org/git/CANtyZjSJf5_xbsBC5tUaazFT3uiEgJnx2_kHLwYwKcn50Jy_qg%40mail.gmail.com/focus=288317)
that contains "a rough and still slushy outline" of what remains to be
done. This was then discussed and explained further.

It is not clear if Shawn's proposal and Josh's email were inspired by
Sarah Sharp's remark, and LWN.net's report about it, but anyway it
looks like hopefully this old and annoying problem is going to be
fixed not too far away into the future.

### Reviews

* [config: add '--show-origin' option to print the origin of a config value](https://public-inbox.org/git/1455531466-16617-4-git-send-email-larsxschneider%40gmail.com/)

For some time Lars Schneider has been sending versions of a short
patch series to make it possible to see where a config option comes
from ([v1](https://public-inbox.org/git/1454661750-85703-1-git-send-email-larsxschneider%40gmail.com/), [v2](https://public-inbox.org/git/1455099198-11515-1-git-send-email-larsxschneider%40gmail.com/), [v3](https://public-inbox.org/git/1455373456-64691-1-git-send-email-larsxschneider%40gmail.com/), [v4](https://public-inbox.org/git/1455531466-16617-1-git-send-email-larsxschneider%40gmail.com/), [v5](https://public-inbox.org/git/1455699468-45443-1-git-send-email-larsxschneider%40gmail.com/), [v6](https://public-inbox.org/git/1455873362-66998-1-git-send-email-larsxschneider%40gmail.com/)):

```
$ git config --list --show-origin
file:/Users/john/.gitconfig user.email=john@doe.com
file:/Users/john/.gitconfig alias.co=checkout
file:.git/config    remote.origin.url=https://repos/myrepo.git
```

Lars started this patch series with an [RFC](https://public-inbox.org/git/3226E251-73F9-4410-84DE-49C8FFAD92EB%40gmail.com/)
whereupon Jeff King pointed him to a [previous discussion](https://public-inbox.org/git/20120206062713.GA9699%40sigill.intra.peff.net/)
about the same idea. Jeff also posted his initial implementation which
Lars' v1 was based on.

The new feature can be useful because config options can be set in
different locations and sometimes it is hard to find where a 
specific config was defined. Usually a config is defined in one of the 
following files:

- the ".git/config" file at the root of the working directory,
- the user's "~/.gitconfig" file,
- the user's "~/.config/git/config" file, or
- a system wide "/etc/gitconfig" file.

The exact paths of the above files depend on how git was compiled
and on the values of at least the GIT_CONFIG, GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM,
GIT_DIR and XDG_CONFIG_HOME environment variables.

In addition config values can be set on the command line (`git -c <key>=<value> config ...`),
from another file (`git config -f <file> ...`), from standard input (`git config < ...`), or 
even from a blob (`git config --blob=a9d9f9`). A config file can also 
include another config file by using the "include.path = <path>" 
directive.

Although the implementation itself was straightforward many details around
the naming required a thoughtful discussion by Sebastian Schuberth, Jeff King,
Ramsay Jones, Mike Rappazzo and Junio Hamano. Eventually the list agreed
on the config option name '--show-origin' and the prefixes 'file', 
'command line', 'standard input' and 'blob' for the different config types.

The `git config` option also has a number of different modes (`--get`, `--list`, ...) 
and it was discussed which of them should be supported by '--show-origin'.

Many details in the code and tests where also discussed by Eric
Sunshine, Johannes Schindelin, Johannes Sixt, Jeff, Ramsay and Junio.

One nice side effect of this patch series is that in case of a config error 
Git can now tell more precisely from what type of config the error originates 
from (e.g. `standard input` or `file`).

* [add DEVELOPER makefile knob to check for acknowledged warnings](https://public-inbox.org/git/1456389742-48052-1-git-send-email-larsxschneider%40gmail.com/)  (*written by Lars Schneider*)

Jeff King noted in a [review](https://public-inbox.org/git/1454661750-85703-1-git-send-email-larsxschneider%40gmail.com/focus=285568) 
that *git style doesn't allow declaration-after-statement*. Thereupon
Lars Schneider posted a [patch](https://public-inbox.org/git/1454921958-53129-1-git-send-email-larsxschneider%40gmail.com/) 
to check for this warning in the TravisCI build. In the review of this 
patch Jeff [suggested](https://public-inbox.org/git/1454921958-53129-1-git-send-email-larsxschneider%40gmail.com//focus=285761)
to codify the knowledge about the warnings into an optional Makefile knob 
called "DEVELOPER". Lars combined the warnings that [Junio and Jeff](https://public-inbox.org/git/1454921958-53129-1-git-send-email-larsxschneider%40gmail.com//focus=285761) care about and posted a revised version of the [patch](https://public-inbox.org/git/1456389742-48052-1-git-send-email-larsxschneider%40gmail.com/).

Git developers with a reasonably modern compiler can now compile Git with 
`DEVELOPER=1 make` or set the flag once for all make executions with 
`echo DEVELOPER=1 >>config.mak` to ensure their patches are clear of all 
compiler warnings that the Git project cares about.

## Developer Spotlight: Sebastian Schuberth

* Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm a passionate software engineer with a wide range of interests and
focus on quality, but I'm particularly interested in cross-platform
development. As a techie I'm always trying to look over the rim of a
tea cup to learn something new. Since a while, I got more and more
interested in taking build automation to the extreme and helping other
developers to get the most out of Git, their other tools, and CI.
Also, I consider myself sort of a Git Evangelist, promoting the use of
Git and teaching it to people where ever I can.

* What would you name your most important contribution to Git?

My contributions so far have mostly revolved around running Git on
Windows, which is why only small portions of my work are visible
upstream. I guess my most important contribution so far is the Git for
Windows installer, which I started about 7 years ago. It gave a face
to Git on Windows and lowered the hurdle for Windows developers to
give Git a try.

* What are you doing on the Git project these days, and why?

Recently, I've not been contributing much to Git, neither to upstream
nor the Windows port. This is mostly due to time constraints, my
choice of programming languages I (currently) like to work with, and
also personal dissensions. Instead, I focus on other tools in the Git
ecosystem, like JGit and Gerrit.

* If you could get a team of expert developers to work full time on
  something in Git for a full year, what would it be?

Wow, that's a very temping idea :-) There are many small nuisances
that deserve to be addressed, but if I was to name a single big topic,
I'd say Git should be rewritten as a library, probably by just using
libgit2 and making the CLI a thin wrapper around it. As a side effect
this would mean to implement all of Git in C, and not use any Shell /
Perl / Python scripts anymore, which both improves performance and
portability.

* If you could remove something from Git without worrying about
  backwards compatibility, what would it be?

There's not one big thing that comes to my mind, but I believe a
general clean-up of legacy code, deprecated command line options and
wording in the docs could help :-)

* What is your favourite Git-related tool/library, outside of Git
  itself?

If I think about which Git-related tool has added the most value to
code I work on in terms of code quality, that would certainly be
Gerrit. It's UI is not the nicest, but gitk / git gui users will
hardly notice ;-) And even in the GitHub-times Gerrit is vastly
superior in the information it can display, like diffs between
different iterations of patches.

## Releases
