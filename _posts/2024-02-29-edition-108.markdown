* [[Bug?] "`git diff --no-rename A B`"](https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqq34uvtpob.fsf@gitster.g/)

  Junio Hamano, the Git maintainer, sent an email to the mailing list
  saying that when `git diff` was used with `--no-rename` instead of
  `--no-renames`, rename detection was still performed. He
  wondered if that was a bug, because either `--no-rename` should be
  interpreted as being a shortened form of `--no-renames`, which is
  [a valid option](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff#Documentation/git-diff.txt---no-renames)
  and should disable rename detection, or `--no-rename` should be
  rejected with an error message and termination of `git diff`.

  Dragan Simic replied to Junio that indeed, in case the option is not
  recognized, an error message should be emitted.

  Jeff King, alias Peff, also replied to Junio saying he tried
  `--no-foo`, which properly errored out. He then wondered if it could
  be a bug in the `parse-options` code that could be confused because
  `git diff` has both `--[no-]rename-empty` and `--no-renames`. As
  there is an abbreviation ambiguity between `--no-rename-empty` and
  `--no-renames` when `--no-rename` is used, the `parse-options` code
  should not allow such an abbreviation and should error out.

  He suggested, as an alternative to fixing the bug, that a new
  `--renames` option could be introduced. It would be synonymous to
  `--find-renames`, which is currently the only opposite to
  `--no-renames`. He proposed a patch to do that and showed that after
  his patch, `--no-rename` would properly error out.

  René Scharfe replied to Peff that the issue came from a patch
  written in 2019 that disabled abbreviated options when there could
  be an ambiguity. The code handling abbreviations would trigger not
  only if the condition guarding it was satisfied, but also if it was
  reached through a `goto` statement. The patch disabling abbreviated
  options only took care of the condition guarding that code, but not of
  the `goto` statement. Along with these explanations, René provided a
  patch fixing the bug.

  Junio thanked René for spotting the "nasty" bug and said he agreed
  that the code was confusing.

  René replied to Junio with a follow-up patch removing the
  `goto` statement.

  Peff also replied to René's first patch wondering if it fixed all
  the possible issues, but then in a reply to himself agreed that
  René's patch was indeed fixing all the issues discussed.

  Junio later merged both of René's patches, and they were part of the
  recently released Git versions 2.43.2, 2.43.3 and 2.44.0.
