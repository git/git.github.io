## Git Rev News: Edition 93 (November 30th, 2022)

Welcome to the 93rd edition of [Git Rev News](https://git.github.io/rev_news/rev_news/),
a digest of all things Git. For our goals, the archives, the way we work, and how to contribute or to
subscribe, see [the Git Rev News page](https://git.github.io/rev_news/rev_news/) on [git.github.io](http://git.github.io).

This edition covers what happened during the month of October 2022.

## Discussions

### Reviews

* [[PATCH] archive: add --recurse-submodules to git-archive command](https://lore.kernel.org/git/pull.1359.git.git.1665597148042.gitgitgadget@gmail.com/)

  Heather Lapointe sent a patch to the mailing list that
  enabled `git archive` to also include submodule contents in the
  archives it produces.

  She said she was inspired by
  [a GitHub issue more than 160 upvotes](https://github.com/dear-github/dear-github/issues/214)
  and thought the implementation wouldn't be too difficult as most of
  the plumbing was already in place.

  One of the trickier parts was changing the `read_tree()` function to
  support other repos than the current one by not using the
  `the_repository` global variable.

  Heather soon sent
  [a version 2 patch series](https://lore.kernel.org/git/pull.1359.v2.git.git.1665660960.gitgitgadget@gmail.com/).
  This patch series contained only 2 patches. The first one was
  identical to the one previously sent, while the second one fixed a
  submodule traversal bug in `read_tree()` introduced by the first
  patch.

  René Scharfe replied to Heather, noticing that the cover letter of
  the patch series had a TODO list with a number of items, most of
  which seemingly already addressed. As the stats in the cover letter
  showed 16 files changed, 269 insertions, and 96 deletions, he said it
  was a bit much for a few patches, and suggested splitting them.

  Heather replied to René that the TODO list came from GitGitGadget.
  And René found that this tool was using an
  [HTML-to-text converter](https://github.com/html-to-text/node-html-to-text)
  that [doesn't handle checkboxes nicely by default](https://github.com/html-to-text/node-html-to-text/issues/260).
  René and Heather then discussed how to split the patches, and a bit
  how the first patch was implemented.

  Heather then sent
  [a version 3 of her patch series](https://lore.kernel.org/git/pull.1359.v3.git.git.1665973401.gitgitgadget@gmail.com/)
  that split her previous patch series into 8 patches.

  Junio Hamano, the Git maintainer, along with Glen Choo, Jonathan
  Tan, Phillip Wood and Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason all commented on some
  of the patches in this series and suggested small improvements.

  The Review Club [selected this patch series](https://lore.kernel.org/git/kl6l35bbsubq.fsf@chooglen-macbookpro.roam.corp.google.com/)
  to be reviewed by participants on Wednesday October 26, and
  participants generally agreed that "this is a really well-structured
  and easy-to-follow series :)" and that "as far as new contributions go,
  this is really good".

  Unfortunately it looks like Heather has been swamped with her own
  work and didn't have time to send a new version yet. Hopefully
  though we will get this very requested feature soon.

  As a side effect of the discussion, [GitGitGadget formats checkboxes nicely now](https://github.com/gitgitgadget/gitgitgadget/pull/1128).

## Developer Spotlight: Bagas Sanjaya

* Who are you and what do you do?

  I'm Bagas Sanjaya. I'm currently unemployed (due to my autistic condition
  that makes working formally isn't the nice option for me).

* What would you name your most important contribution to Git?

  Adding the `INSTALL_STRIP` variable when installing Git from source (with
  help from other Git developers due to lack of coding experience).

* For the benefit of the readers, is it possible for you to elaborate a
  bit on what the `INSTALL_STRIP` variable would help them with?

  Typically users install Git from binary package provided by the
  distribution. For those who wish to install from source, they can
  install build-time dependencies first, then simply do `make && make install`.
  However, it will install Git binaries with debugging info, which
  can take a lot of space. In addition, many Unix systems have `install(1)`
  that has an option to automatically strip debugging info during
  installation. That's why `INSTALL_STRIP` is introduced; if supported,
  users can run `make INSTALL_STRIP=-s install` to install
  stripped binaries.

* What are you doing on the Git project these days, and why?

  I'm mostly translating po strings in recent days. Otherwise I'm hacking
  on Linux kernel documentation.

* If you could get a team of expert developers to work full time on
  something in Git for a full year, what would it be?

  As an autistic man, I'd like to meet developers who can accommodate my
  special needs (often different from neurotypical people) so that I
  can thrive my living.

* It is good to know that you would like to meet compassionate developers.
  Is it possible for you expand a bit on what you would like to change /
  enhance in Git when you get a team of such developers for a year?

  I think more on communication. Sure, communicating with email makes life
  easier for autistic developers (less physical interaction). However,
  autistic people have different ways of communicating. For me, I need
  a lot of time to process the information from a mailing list and formulate
  the wording (which is due to comorbid ADHD). Thus, the community
  expectation should have been adapted to individual needs, e.g. by being
  more explicit on explanation of code of conduct when a new developer
  is contributing. If he/she doesn't understand the CoC, he/she can
  proactively ask the community about points that he/she doesn't understand.

  In summary, besides adaptation from the community, there must be
  initiatives from developers themselves.

* What is your favorite Git-related tool/library, outside of Git
  itself?

  Gitea. I deployed the server application to the LXD instance on my
  laptop as repository mirror when I push my favorite repos there.

* You have experience translating for Git. Is there something that
  could be done differently to aid with the translation effort?

  I think we need something like self-hosted Weblate to enable anyone
  with translation skills to easily submit translated strings. But honestly
  deploying one is tricky; I tried to deploy Weblate but couldn't get strings
  from Git source code to be available for translation on the interface.

* How does your mailing list workflow look like?

  Simplicistic. After configuring `git send-email` to send through outgoing
  relay of your mail provider and your email clients to send plain text
  email, unaltered (no line wrapping, intact tabs and spaces), you can
  contribute by sending patches with the former and reviewing with the
  latter.

* What is your advice for people who want to start Git development?
  Where and how should they start?

  You need to find a joy in application development. If it doesn't makes
  you enjoy, you may need to take a break or find something else.

* If there's one tip you would like to share with other Git
  developers, what would it be?

  As autistic, special interest fascinates me. You need to find one
  in this project, while staying up-to-date with the general picture.
