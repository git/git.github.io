## Git Rev News: Edition 37 (March 21st, 2018)

Welcome to the 37th edition of [Git Rev News](https://git.github.io/rev_news/rev_news/),
a digest of all things Git. For our goals, the archives, the way we work, and how to contribute or to
subscribe, see [the Git Rev News page](https://git.github.io/rev_news/rev_news/) on [git.github.io](http://git.github.io).

This edition covers what happened from the month of February 2018 up
to the [Git Merge](https://git-merge.com/) conference on March 7th and 8th 2018.

## Discussions

### General

* Git Merge 2018 conference

Another exciting [Git Merge](https://git-merge.com/) happened this year, this time in the lovely city of Barcelona in Catalonia, Spain. Surrounded by crazy skaters, two days full of Git happened, with a couple of add-on events on both ends.

* A few days before the conference Jeff King, alias Peff, posted a [Git / Software Freedom Conservancy status report (2018)](https://public-inbox.org/git/20180306231609.GA1632@sigill.intra.peff.net/) and a [git-scm.com update](https://public-inbox.org/git/20180306230419.GA1373@sigill.intra.peff.net/).
* The usual Git Contributor Summit was held in parallel to the workshop day. Alex Vandiver provided a nice [write-up](https://public-inbox.org/git/alpine.DEB.2.20.1803091557510.23109@alexmv-linux/) of the event, which felt more focused on concrete projects than in the last years. Be sure to read through the replies that add more information, still.
* In his [Opening Session](https://git-merge.com/#brett-smith) of the Git Merge, Brett Smith from the Software Freedom Conservancy invited everyone to have a moment of silence in memory of Shawn Pearce (see [edition 36](https://git.github.io/rev_news/2018/02/21/edition-36/)).
* Plastic SCM's Semantic Merge was not only presented in a [talk](https://git-merge.com/#pablo-santos-luaces), but made available as a bot called ["mergedroid"](https://gmaster.io/mergedroid) that applies the same merge conflict resolution to Pull Requests on GitHub.
* A big theme this year was to apply Git to files other than source code:
  * Stephen Hathaway detailed how [designers use Git to work on visual design](https://git-merge.com/#stephen-hathaway).
  * William Chia described how [GitLab uses Git to collaborate on documents](https://git-merge.com/#william-chia).
  * The xltrail product makes it possible to use [Git to manage Excel files](https://www.xltrail.com) (this was demo'ed between talks by Felix Zumstein).

### Support

* [Is there any way to "interrupt" a rebase?](https://public-inbox.org/git/CAE1pOi1XtrWqG7mOdrNt10YoZG0LOAB7i9cc1Gi8oWhULxE57A@mail.gmail.com/)

Hilco Wijbenga explained to the mailing list that sometimes when a
rebase fails because of rebase/merge conflicts, he would like to
"rewind" the rebase to an earlier commit and restart from there. This
would be useful for example when the earlier commit is the right
commit where a conflict should be fixed.

His current solution is to abort the rebase and start over with
`git rebase --interactive` and then "edit" commits. This doesn't work
well though when a lot of conflicts have already been resolved before
the earlier commit he would "rewind" to, because, when the original
rebase is aborted, all the work that already went into resolving
conflicts is lost.

Brian Carlson replied to Hilco that in this case he unstages all the
changes from the index, then makes the change that should have gone
into the earlier commit, uses `git commit --fixup` (or `--squash`),
and then restages the rest of the changes and continues with the
rebase. He can then use `git rebase -i --autosquash` afterwards to
insert the fixup commit into the right place.

Hilco replied to Brian that he ends up doing that too, but it doesn't
work well when the fixup commit is not easy to move to the right
place.

Jeff King, alias Peff, replied to Hilco's original email saying that
`git rerere` should help reapplying conflict resolutions. He also
suggested to "simply pick the resolved state at each step" when
repeating the rebase, using for example `git tag failed` to remember
the failed attempt, and then `git checkout failed~4 --` to pick
conflict resolutions from the failed attempt.

Peff alternatively suggested "rewinding" using `git reset --hard` and
then, after fixing the earlier commit, using `git cherry-pick` to
cherry-pick commits with conflict resolutions from the failed attempt.

Johannes Schindelin, alias Dscho, also replied to Hilco. Dscho first
suggested basically the same workflow as Peff's alternative
suggestion.

He then suggested an alternative strategy which consists in copying
parts of the $GIT_DIR/rebase-merge/done file to the beginning of the
$GIT_DIR/rebase-merge/git-rebase-todo file, instead of cherry-picking
commits. This copying would in effect "rewind" the original rebase.

Dscho mentioned that a new interactive rebase subcommand could be
created to facilitate using this strategy. The new subcommand could
"make use of the fact that the interactive rebase accumulates mappings
between the original commits and the rewritten ones" in the
$GIT_DIR/rebase-merge/rewritten-list file.

Phillip Wood also replied to Hilco's first email suggesting something
similar as Dscho's alternative strategy. Phillip suggested using
`git log --pretty="pick %h %s" <earlier_commit>..` followed by
`git rebase --edit-todo` to edit the git-rebase-todo file, and then
`git checkout <earlier_commit>` to rewind.

In a subsequent email replying to himself Dscho elaborated on a
possible new subcommand. He proposed
`git rebase --replay-latest-commits 3` and a sightly different way to
copy commits to the git-rebase-todo file so that it contains commits
with resolved merge conflicts.

Phillip replied to Dscho that it's the reason why he actually uses
`git log --pretty="pick %h %s" <earlier_commit>..` to get the lines
that should be pasted at the beginning of the git-rebase-todo file.

Peff replied to Dscho suggesting a "general form" of Dscho's proposal
that would be called `git rebase --rewind` and that could "undo" the
prior rebase command whatever it is.

Jacob Keller, alias Jake, chimed in to support Peff's suggestion and
Hilco's wish of "a \-\-rewind that simply tracks the point of each
history and can reset back to each".
