* [clean: new option --exclude-from](https://public-inbox.org/git/1448549065-16337-1-git-send-email-rouzier%40gmail.com/)

James Rouzier sent a patch to add a new `--exclude-from=<file>` option
to `git clean`. It looked quite straightforward, but as often Eric
Sunshine found many small things that could be improved upon. James
and Eric then agreed on what should be done, and it looked like a
clear roadmap had been set for this new feature.

That's when Jeff King, alias Peff, wrote the following:

> Lots of commands care about excludes (e.g., "add", "status").
> 
> Should this perhaps be an option to the main "git" to append to the set

This started a discussion between Junio Hamano, the git maintainer,
and Peff about how exclude files should be specified to commands.

It is a complex topic because there are already different ways to pass
an exclude file, for example there is also `.git/info/exclude`. And
there is the question of how the option should be passed to sub
commands.

In the end it is not clear if the patch will be accepted.

* [remote-http(s): Support SOCKS proxies](https://public-inbox.org/git/bf218d020e24216f55d1514c4459e645b13ec075.1445865176.git.johannes.schindelin%40gmx.de/)

In a patch series called
["Miscellaneous platform-independent patches from Git for Windows"](https://public-inbox.org/git/cover.1445865176.git.johannes.schindelin%40gmx.de/)
Johannes Schindelin, alias Dscho, sent a patch from Pat Thoyts that adds SOCKS proxies support to Git:

> With this patch we properly support SOCKS proxies, configured e.g. like
> this:
> 
> 	git config http.proxy socks5://192.168.67.1:32767
> 
> Without this patch, Git mistakenly tries to use SOCKS proxies as if they
> were HTTP proxies, resulting in a error message like:
> 
> 	fatal: unable to access 'http://.../': Proxy CONNECT aborted
> 
> This patch was required to work behind a faulty AP and scraped from
> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15227130/#15228479 and guarded with
> an appropriate cURL version check by Johannes Schindelin.

The last paragraph made Junio Hamano wonder "What is the licensing
status of the original at SO?"

James McCoy answered that [according to Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/help/licensing)
"all user contributions are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike".

Unfortunately as Junio replied, the Creative Commons Attribution-Share
Alike, alias BY-SA, does not mesh well with GPLv2 that Git uses. That's
why Dscho asked Pat if he could give his Signed-off-by mention,
which would mean that he agrees to relicense his work under the GPLv2.

Junio, after consulting his IP lawyer friends, replied that asking Pat
was indeed the best thing to do.

Ten days later Pat eventually gave his Signed-off-by which fixed the
problem.

## Developer Spotlight: Stefan Beller

* Who are you, and what do you do?

I write Git/Gerrit code for a living at Google. I started coding when I
was 10 years old with a tool called GameMaker for DOS. As I did not
know how to version my games back then, deep down in my digital life
(http://www.xkcd.com/1360/), I admit having folders called v1, v2, v3.

* What would you name your most important contribution to Git?

I think all the patches I contributed using various static code analysis
tools. These were small issues such as memory leaks each, but as a
whole they made Git better. Which also leads to answering the next
question ...

* What are you doing on the Git project these days, and why?

I started diving into Submodule Code lately. The first patches
which just landed in origin/master don't do a lot, except making
submodules a little faster by rewriting shell in C. This is
the same approach as I had in the previous question, looking
for stuff under the hood and improving there, is usually not controversial,
so a good thing to start out with when exploring new areas of code.

* If you could get a team of expert developers to work full time on
something in Git for a full year, what would it be?

I would ask the experts for a Git protocol version 2 as that
makes repositories with lots of refs go smoothly over the wire.
For example every time you fetch git.git today from
https://github.com/gitster/git/,
more than 100kB are sent over the wire and most of it is moot.
A fetch today and a fetch a week ago would only differ in 5kB in
these first 100kB sent over the wire.
While Git as maintained by Junio has more refs than the usual
repository (currently 1626 refs), there are other projects which are
even larger than Git itself in the ref space.

* If you could remove something from Git without worrying about
backwards compatibility, what would it be?

I think I just point at
http://stevelosh.com/blog/2013/04/git-koans/#the-hobgoblin
where the subtle inconsistencies are put into a spotlight.

* What is your favourite Git-related tool/library, outside of Git itself?

I did use only Git itself, no third party tools otherwise until recently.
Now I am into Gerrit a bit for reviewing changes before it's too late.
