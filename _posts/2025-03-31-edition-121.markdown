### General

* [10 years of Git Rev News](https://git.github.io/rev_news/archive/)

  Git Rev News started 10 years ago with
  [edition 1 published on March 25, 2015](https://git.github.io/rev_news/2015/03/25/edition-1/),
  and then one edition per month.

  To celebrate, let's look at some stats that we have gathered about
  these first 120 editions.

  + First we would like to thank all those who helped us so far.

    This includes those who helped with ideas, links, PRs, small
    corrections, letting us know about a Git related software release,
    and even sometimes full articles without being part of our editor
    team. Here is the top 12 along with the number of editions they
    helped us with, according to our "Credits" section, and the number
    of commits they contributed:

    - Johannes Schindelin: 29 editions and 71 commits
    - Bruno Brito: 25 editions and 36 commits
    - Luca Milanesio: 19 editions and 23 commits
    - Štěpán Němec: 18 editions and 22 commits
    - Junio Hamano: 13 editions and 22 commits
    - Philip Oakley: 10 editions and 10 commits
    - Elijah Newren: 10 editions and 9 commits
    - Andrew Ardill: 8 editions and 15 commits
    - David Pursehouse: 8 editions and 12 commits
    - Jeff King: 8 editions and 5 commits
    - Matthieu Moy: 6 editions and 14 commits
    - Lars Schneider: 6 editions and 14 commits

    In total, more than 125 people helped this way.

    Former members of the editor team helped a lot, too:

    - Thomas Ferris Nicolaisen: 33 editions and 135 commits
    - Gabriel Alcaras: 22 editions and 7 commits
    - Nicola Paolucci: 16 editions and 5 commits

    A small number of people have also helped us by contributing to
    [our scripts](https://github.com/chriscool/getreleases/) to
    automate parts of the edition and publication process:

    - Gabriel Alcaras: 9 commits
    - David Aguilar: 3 commits
    - Mirth Hickford: 2 commits

  + A number of people helped by accepting to be interviewed in our
    "Developer Spotlight" or "Community Spotlight" sections. Thanks to
    them, too:

    - Total interviews: 72
    - Unique interviewees: 70
    - Repeat interviews: 2 (David Aguilar and Eric Sunshine have been interviewed twice)
    - Developer interviews: 70
    - Community interviews: 2

  + Most of the long articles are in a "Discussions" section and in
    one of its subsections: "General", "Reviews" or "Support". Here
    are some related stats:

    Total over all the editions:

    - Discussions articles: 254
    - General articles: 106
    - Reviews articles: 79
    - Support articles: 69

    Average per edition:

    - Discussions: 2.12
    - General: 0.88
    - Reviews: 0.66
    - Support: 0.57

    Text Statistics:

    - Total words: 100,434
    - Total lines: 14,090
    - Total paragraphs: 3,097

    Average per article:

    - Words: 395.4
    - Lines: 55.5
    - Paragraphs: 12.2

    Total words per section:

    - General: 29,220 words
    - Reviews: 35,912 words
    - Support: 35,302 words

  + Among those long articles, 16 articles were written by people
    outside the editor team. Big thanks to them! The top 3 is:

    - Junio Hamano: 4
    - Matthieu Moy: 3
    - Jacob Keller: 2

    The following people wrote one article each:

    Andrew Ardill, Elijah Newren, Eric S. Raymond, Eric Sunshine,
    Jiang Xin, Lars Schneider.

    One article was also written collaboratively by the following
    students:

    François Beutin, Jordan De Gea, William Duclot, Samuel Groot,
    Erwan Mathonière, Antoine Queru, Simon Rabourg and Tom Russello.

    These articles were mostly written towards the first years of Git
    Rev News:

    - 2015: 8 articles
    - 2016: 2 articles
    - 2018: 2 articles
    - 2019: 1 article
    - 2020: 3 articles

  + There were 2298 entries in the "Other News" section,
    which gathers links to various news, articles, sites, tools,
    and sometimes media about Git (or related to Git).

    Those entries include:

    - 1090 entries in "Light reading" over 114 editions
      with 1777 links; around 13.76% of entries mention previous editions.
    - 691 entries in "Git tools and sites" over 118 editions
      with 1270 links; around 11.72% of entries mention previous editions.
    - 411 entries in "Various" over 110 editions
      with 635 links; around 7.06% of entries mention previous editions.
    - 20 entries in "Events" over 12 editions
      with 39 links
    - 15 entries in "Easy watching" over 12 editions
      with 31 links; of those, 3 entries mention previous editions.

    There were quite a few one-off names of sub-lists, like
    "Slightly heavier reading", "April Fool's", "Listening and watching".
    The template with standardized names was not present in the 1st edition,
    but was created later.


* [Git participated in the December 2024 Outreachy round](https://www.outreachy.org/alums/2024-12/)

  internship:

    testing framework" project, mentored by Patrick Steinhardt and
    Phillip Wood. See
    [his completion email](https://lore.kernel.org/git/CAGedMtcLRjr0GVNYmUU_tacrA0aRvOCYFGyOy0FACTBL=X3cwA@mail.gmail.com/)
    and

## Developer Spotlight: Peter Krefting

* **Who are you and what do you do?**

  My name is Peter Krefting and I am a software engineer. Hailing from Sweden,
  I moved to Norway for my first job, at Opera Software, mostly working on
  internals such as Unicode support and internal libraries. I ended up staying
  in Norway and am currently working for a small company providing monitoring
  equipment for digital TV.

* **What are you doing on the Git project these days, and why?**

  My answers to these two are the same, I am the maintainer of the
  [Swedish translation of Git](https://github.com/git-l10n/git-po/blob/master/po/sv.po).
  I like having software running in my own language, and sometimes
  you have to take matters in your own hands.

* **If you could get a team of expert developers to work full time on
  something in Git for a full year, what would it be?**

  I think [`git gui`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui) and
  [`gitk`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk) could need some extra love,
  these are my daily drivers, in addition to the command line.

* **Is there something that developers could do to ease the life of
  translators?**

  My main gripe is using library function names as verbs,
  like `cannot fsync`. That's hard to read even in the original
  language, even for a C developer like myself.

* **What is your favorite Git-related tool/library, outside of
  Git itself?**

  I like simple and clean interfaces, so using [cgit](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Cgit)
  to visualize history on a web server is very nice.

* **What is your toolbox for interacting with the mailing list and for
  development of Git?**

  I mostly just read the mailing list, and only a small percentage of the
  posts to it; the localization is handled through [GitHub pull requests](https://github.com/git-l10n/git-po/pulls?q=is%3Apr),
  so that's where that work happens. The few patches I have sent to the
  mailing list have been very manual, using `git format-patch` and
  the [Alpine mail client](https://alpineapp.email/).

* **What is your advice for people who want to start Git development?
  Where and how should they start?**

  Find some small part you want to improve, and work on that. Git is a
  fairly complex piece of software, implemented in several different
  languages, making it hard to get an overview. I most definitely do not have that,
  even after having read (and translated) most of the user-visible strings.
