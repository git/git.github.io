+ [Bug report: v2.47.0 cannot fetch version 1 pack indexes](https://lore.kernel.org/git/BA07EFA0-0793-420D-BED9-ACD7CEBE0112@townlong-yak.com/)

  Someone called 'fox' reported that when upgrading Git to v2.47.0
  from v2.46.2 or a previous version, cloning from their website,
  which uses the old "dumb HTTP" protocol, stopped working. With
  v2.47.0 there is an error message indicating that some index files
  "differ in contents".

  Using `git bisect`, fox found the commit that introduced the
  issue. That commit implemented a check that verified that the index
  file downloaded from the remote was byte-for-byte identical with the
  index file generated locally from the Git objects downloaded as part
  of the clone.

  That check failed because the remote had an index in the version 1
  format, while the locally generated index was in a more recent
  format. And fox wondered if this was intentional.

  Eric Sunshine replied to fox that he could reproduce the problem.

  Jeff King, alias Peff, also replied to fox saying that the breakage
  was not intended. He thought that it was better to rely on the
  locally generated index, but that there should be no guarantee for
  it to be identical to the downloaded one.

  Peff proposed a draft patch that discarded the downloaded version
  before generating an index, but said it was hacky and didn't check
  that the content was the same. So he suggested a better solution.

  He then proposed an improved draft patch, which implemented the
  better solution he had suggested by marking the downloaded index as
  temporary and then discarding it after a new one is generated.

  Taylor Blau, who was the temporary Git maintainer while Junio
  Hamano, the usual maintainer, had some time off, replied to Eric and
  fox in the meantime confirming it was an unintentional breakage, and
  saying he was going to look at Peff's patches.

  Taylor then discussed with Peff the first draft patch and agreed
  with Peff that the solution implemented in the improved draft patch
  was better.

  So Taylor reviewed Peff's improved draft patch. He made some
  comments but found it good, and asked Peff to add a test and to
  propose it as a regular patch.

  Peff replied to Taylor's comments, proposed a draft test, and said
  he was going to work on a proper patch as well as some cleanups and
  refactors in the dumb HTTP code.

  Taylor found Peff's draft test "beautifully written".

  Peff then sent
  [a series made of 11 patches](https://lore.kernel.org/git/20241025064148.GA2110169@coredump.intra.peff.net/)
  to fix the issue, clean up the dumb HTTP code and fix a couple of
  other bugs or potential bugs he found in the process.

  Taylor reviewed the patch series and discussed a few technical
  details with Peff. Overall he found the series good to go and
  eventually merged it.


## Developer Spotlight: Ghanshyam Thakkar

* Who are you and what do you do?

  I am Ghanshyam Thakkar. I was an undergrad student in Electronics
  when I started contributing to Git. I am now a Software Engineer at a
  startup. I sometimes contribute to open source projects in my free time,
  and explore/learn new technologies.

* How did you initially become interested in contributing to Git,
  and what motivated you to choose it as your GSoC project?

  Before GSoC, I was quite familiar with the Linux ecosystem, and it had
  been my primary OS for the majority of my college years. And during
  those times I felt Git was the most impactful project enabling the vastly
  collaborative Linux Desktop Ecosystem. So, I felt like contributing
  to Git would be a great opportunity to learn and contribute to a
  project that had been so crucial to my everyday workflow.

* How do you feel your contribution has impacted the Git community
  or the broader open source ecosystem?

  Before my GSoC project, I had contributed some small patches, which
  could be considered as bug fix, general code cleanup, expanding test
  coverage, etc. Some of which can be observed in user-space. But my GSoC
  project was about migrating Git's test suite to a purely C-based
  test framework, which was not user-facing, however, was a step in the
  right direction for the project as a whole.

* Is there any aspect of Git that you now see differently after
  having contributed to it?

  The mailing list workflow. Although, I was skeptical about it at first
  because I had never used mailing lists before, I now see it as a very
  effective way to communicate and collaborate on a project of such
  massive scale. Although, I still am not a big fan of the all or nothing
  nature of the mailing lists. Subscribing to mails of a specific area
  would have been great. Although, I do understand that it can
  probably be done with filtering using a script.

* How do you balance your contributions with other responsibilities
  like work or school?

  When I was contributing to Git as part of GSoC, I was a student and I
  also had summer vacation, so it was quite easy for me to balance my
  contributions with my personal life. However, now that I am quite busy with my
  $DAYJOB, I don't have much bandwidth to contribute to open
  source in the short term. But I am planning to start contributing again
  after some time.

* Can you share how GSoC helped enhance your technical and
  non-technical skills (like communication, project management, etc.)?

  I would say it helped me improve my technical communication skills immensely.
  Going back and forth with the reviewers on the list, I learned quite a
  bit about how to communicate effectively. Also, this was my first time
  working in a C based project, so I learned some C hacks as well!

* What was your biggest takeaway or learning from GSoC that you now
  apply regularly in your work?

  Technical communication and effective code review. Also more effective
  Git usage.

* What was the biggest challenge you faced during your contributions
  to Git, and how did you overcome it?

  More than the technical challenges solving a problem, I would say it was
  more challenging finding the relevant work to do, as there is no
  official issue tracker. I would search for #leftoverbits on the mailing
  list and #TODOs in the codebase to find things to do. However,
  most of them seemed quite out of reach in terms of difficulty. However,
  I attempted them anyway and learned a lot in the process. The mailing
  list folks were quite helpful in guiding me in the right direction.

* Have you thought about mentoring new GSoC students?

  Yes, although I don't have the bandwidth to become a primary mentor,
  I would love to be a co-mentor.

* If you could get a team of expert developers to work full time on
  something in Git for a full year, what would it be?

  Honestly, I find Git to be quite mature and complete. I can't
  think of anything, off the top of my head, that I would like
  people to work on for a full year.

* What upcoming features or changes in Git are you particularly
  excited about?

  Rust adoption.

* What is your favorite Git-related tool/library, outside of Git
  itself?

  I quite frequently find myself using [`lazygit`](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit)
  on the command line for some quick and dirty Git operations.

* What is your toolbox for interacting with the mailing list and for
  development of Git?

  I use [aerc](https://aerc-mail.org/) and `send-email`/`format-patch`
  for email interactions. And for development, I use [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
  and [clangd LSP](https://gist.github.com/Strus/042a92a00070a943053006bf46912ae9)
  with the `GENERATE_COMPILATION_DATABASE` build flag.

* How do you envision your own involvement with Git or other open
  source projects in the future?

  I think I will continue to be a part of the open source community in some
  way or the other. My perspective towards open source has always been
  very positive and I would like to continue contributing to it.

* What is your advice for people who want to start Git development?
  Where and how should they start?

  I would suggest to start from reading the docs, particularly
  [MyFirstContribution](https://git-scm.com/docs/MyFirstContribution)
  and [SubmittingPatches](https://git-scm.com/docs/SubmittingPatches).
  And then start with some [#leftoverbits](https://lore.kernel.org/git/?q=%23leftoverbits)
  or if you are particularly interested in a specific area, you can
  even reach out to people working on those areas to ask for guidance.

* Would you recommend other students or contributors to participate in
  the GSoC, or other mentoring programs, working on Git? Why? Do you
  have advice for them?

  Absolutely! GSoC is a great opportunity to learn and contribute to open
  source projects. It is a great way to learn how a project of such
  massive scale is managed and developed.
