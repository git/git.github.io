## Git Rev News: Edition 15 (May 11th, 2016)

Welcome to the 15th edition of [Git Rev News](https://git.github.io/rev_news/rev_news/),
a digest of all things Git. For our goals, the archives, the way we work, and how to contribute or to
subscribe, see [the Git Rev News page](https://git.github.io/rev_news/rev_news/) on [git.github.io](https://git.github.io).

This edition covers what happened during the month of April 2016,
especially at the Git Contributor Summit on April 4 2016 and at the
Git Merge conference on April 5 2016.

## Discussions

### General

* Discussions at the Git Contributor Summit, part 2, about misc topics

*Read part 1 in [Git Rev News Edition 14](https://git.github.io/rev_news/2016/04/20/edition-14/)* 

At the Git Contributor Summit on April 4th, just after the lunch
break, the state of the participation of the Git project in the Google
Summer of Code (GSoC) and Outreachy were briefly mentioned. Jeff King,
alias Peff, then talked about the state of the Git project as a member of
[Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/).

Git is one of Conservancy's Member Projects. Conservancy manages the legal and
administrative aspects of the Git project, and also manages Git's
money, which amounts to around $20000. This money comes mostly from
donations made on git-scm.org, GSoC mentor stipends, and book
royalties. The money has been used in the past to pay for some
developers to travel to conferences like Git Merge, and may be used in
the future to pay Outreachy student stipends.

The governance of the Git project as part of Conservancy is in the hands
of Junio Hamano, Shawn Pearce, and Jeff King. The main activity of the
governance consists in handling trademark issues related to the "Git"
trademark that the project owns.

There are a number of projects who call themselves "Git XXX" and the
trademark policy on git-scm.org is used to decide if those trademarks
are approved or not.

Another activity is related to defending the license, which is the
GPLv2. For example, there have previously been vendors distributing
Git with some changes, but without providing the source code for the Git version they
were distributing. So far it has been possible to resolve these cases, but
it is not completely clear if all vendors are currently fullfilling all of
their obligations. If any developers who have contributed to Git
want to take a closer look at what the vendors are doing, Conservancy is
able to help them.

After that SubmitGit was discussed as well as ways to make it easier
for people who are not yet Git developers to contribute. TravisCI,
which can be used to automatically test pull requests that are
submitted on GitHub, was also discussed at the same time.

It appeared that it would be good to also be able to test pull
requests on Windows machines, but TravisCI doesn't support Windows
yet. To help on this GitLab CEO Sytse "Sid" Sijbrandij offered to
let the project use GitLab CI, which supports Linux, OSX, and Windows.

Various subjects were then discussed a bit, like case insensitive
refnames and filenames, submodules, and Git on Celph, which is a file
system for computer clusters.

A mix of long time and quite new Git contributors, along with people
from Git related projects and companies, attended. The atmosphere was
relaxed and informal. Overall it was a very pleasant event.

* [20 Tricks with Git and Shell](https://speakerdeck.com/nibalizer/20-tricks-with-git-and-bash)

At the [Git Merge conference](http://git-merge.com/) on April 5th 2016
at [New World Stages](http://newworldstages.com/) in New York City,
USA, Spencer Krum, who works for IBM in Portland and appears to be a
big fan of
[Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/), gave
an interesting and fast-paced presentation about some shell and Git
command line tricks.

Some of the tricks he showed are available in his
['bash-tricks' GitHub repository](https://github.com/nibalizer/bash-tricks).

The presentation started with simple shell aliases like `alias
sl='ls'` to cope with typos and `alias g='git'` to reduce typing, then
a bit more complex ones to avoid typing common arguments like `alias
gpom='git push origin master'` and `alias pydoc='python -m pydoc'`,
until validation aliases like:

```
alias yamlcheck='python -c "import sys, yaml as y; y.safe_load(open(sys.argv[1]))"'
```

Spencer then spoke about customized prompts for git, filesystems and
tools, and about git config aliases. For example, this alias that makes
grepping through your submodules easy:

```
[alias]
	sgrep = "!f() { git submodule foreach \"git grep '$1'; true \"
			| grep -B 1 \"$1\"; }; f"
```

After that came functions. Some were general like:

```
# Get to the top of a git tree
cdp () {
  TEMP_PWD=`pwd`
  while ! [ -d .git ]; do
  cd ..
  done
  OLDPWD=$TEMP_PWD
}
```

Others were related to Gerrit or GitHub:

```
# Check out a Pull request from github
function pr() {
  id=$1
  if [ -z $id ]; then
      echo "Need Pull request number as argument"
      return 1
  fi
  git fetch origin pull/${id}/head:pr_${id}
  git checkout pr_${id}
}
```

In the end Spencer showed how to combine multiple small features to
get something interesting. Take the following 3 tricks:

* Vim can be started at a given line by giving the line in a +[num] argument, for example `vim +24`
* The previous command typed on the command line can be obtained using `history | tail -n 2 | head -1`
* `git grep -n XXX` will show a grep result from Git with a line number

These 3 small tricks can be used in the following big one:

```
# Have vim inspect command history
vim () {
    last_command=$(history | tail -n 2 | head -n 1)
    if [[ $last_command =~ 'git grep' ]] && [[ "$*" =~ :[0-9]+:$ ]]; then
        line_number=$(echo $* | awk -F: '{print $(NF-1)}')
        /usr/bin/vim +${line_number} ${*%:${line_number}:}
    else
        /usr/bin/vim "$@"
    fi
}
```

That makes vim open file "foo" at line "X" if one uses `vim foo:X`
just after having run `git grep`.

* [GSoC 2016](https://public-inbox.org/git/CAFZEwPMr%3Dimv%3D%3DkvVULy4PDYKW-0RRQ5a%2BX8DFqNFhNjCSyWKA%40mail.gmail.com/)

This year only one student, Pranit Bauva, will participate in the
Google Summer of Code 2016 under the Git project. He will work on
incrementaly rewriting in C the parts of "git bisect" that are still
in shell. He will be mentored by Lars Schneider and Christian Couder.

## Developer Spotlight: David Turner

* Who are you, what do you do and why were you at the Git Merge?

I am a free software developer (and occasional board game designer). I
currently work on developer tools at Twitter.  My focus is on making
Git faster.  I was at Git Merge and the Git Core Contributors Summit to
meet other Git developers.  I really enjoyed meeting you and the other
contributors.

* What would you name your most important contribution to Git?

My most important contribution was probably ensuring that cache-trees
are written on checkout and commit (from 2014).  I've done a bunch of
work since then on refs, the index-helper, and fixed a few really weird
bugs (http range requests might be the weirdest).  But most of the
performance work I have done is still in-progress.  The cache-tree fix
has been in git since I think 2.2, and it affects daily performance for
anyone using a medium to large repo.

* What are you doing on the Git project these days, and why?

I'm working on a few different things:

    - Alternate ref backends (storing refs in a database)
    - Reviewing protocol v2 patches (and, perhaps, adding new protocol
      capabilities allowing single-branch fetches to be more
      efficient)
    - The index-helper and watchman support for faster status on large
      repositories

* If you could get a team of expert developers to work full time on
something in Git for a full year, what would it be?

I would rewrite all index access code to only look a the relevant
portions of the index.  Right now, many Git commands scan the entire
index, which does not scale well.  It would be much better if git
status and related commands ran in O(number of changes) instead of
O(size of repository).  This would be a major effort, but the end
result would be a much faster Git.

* If you could remove something from Git without worrying about
backwards compatibility, what would it be?

I would completely redesign the UX.  For instance, the famous
"git checkout $branch" vs "git checkout -b" vs "git checkout $filename"
confusion could be completely eliminated by using a different verb for
each of these things.

My work focuses on performance because that is what I enjoy and am good
at.  But I think UX work is often more important, and I wish that there
were a way to correct some historical UX decisions.

* What is your favourite Git-related tool/library, outside of Git
itself?

Michael Haggerty just showed me [git tbdiff](https://github.com/trast/tbdiff),
which is very useful when rebasing a large patch series.  I also have to mention
[git shamend](http://www.daniellesucher.com/2014/05/08/git-shamend/).
