+ [[PATCH 0/4] Switch links to https](https://lore.kernel.org/git/pull.1589.git.1695392027.gitgitgadget@gmail.com/)

  In September, Josh Soref posted a 4-patch series on the
  mailing list to improve the URLs used throughout the documentation
  and the code base of the project.

  The main goal was to use HTTPS instead of HTTP in the URLs to
  improve user security, but along the way some patches replaced URLs
  that didn't work anymore with some new ones pointing to the same
  content.

  Eric Sunshine replied to Josh's patches asking why one URL was
  changed from `http://json.org/` to `https://www.json.org/` instead
  of just replacing `http` with `https`. Josh replied that it was
  because that website was self-identifying with the latter URL using a
  [meta refresh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_refresh).

  In the meantime, Junio Hamano, the Git maintainer, replied to some
  patches saying that it might not be worth updating some URLs, either
  because it was clear from the context that they were old, or because
  they were part of some code we borrowed from other projects. In some
  cases, they were an argument of a Git command and still just worked,
  while the meaning of the command changed a bit when `http` was
  replaced with `https`. Junio liked the fact that some broken links
  were fixed by the series though.

  Josh then sent a
  [version 2 of his patch series](https://lore.kernel.org/git/pull.1589.v2.git.1695553041.gitgitgadget@gmail.com/).
  This took into account Eric's comments as a commit message was
  improved to say that some changes were made to respect a site's
  self-identification. Junio's comments were also taken into account
  as a number of URLs that were previously changed were now left
  as-is.

  Elijah Newren and Junio commented on this new version. They both
  suggested improving commit messages or the cover letter of the
  series to better explain the reasons for the changes that were made.
  In one case, Elijah and Josh discussed replacing the URL of a
  website that seemed to be often down with a link to its content on
  the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/).

  In November, Josh then sent a
  [version 3 of his patch series](https://lore.kernel.org/git/pull.1589.v3.git.1700796916.gitgitgadget@gmail.com/)
  where the first and second patches had been swapped to avoid some
  confusion for reviewers who would ask why some URLs weren't changed
  in the first patch overlooking that the second one would change them.

  The other significant change compared to version 2 was that Josh
  decided not to replace the URL of the website that was often down
  saying "we'll risk users getting hacked content from an arbitrary
  [MITM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack)
  instead of taking archived authenticated content based on the last
  time their web site was properly maintained".

  Elijah replied that he would be fine with using the archived link if
  it was better justified in the commit message, but said that he also
  agreed with merging the whole series as-is, as he had checked all
  the links and they all looked good to him.

  Josh replied he could come back later to change the URL and preferred
  the series to be merged as-is. He thanked Elijah for taking the time
  to re-check every link, saying he knew exactly how tedious that is.

  Junio agreed with merging the series, which is now part of the
  'master' branch.

## Community Spotlight: VonC

_[VonC](https://stackoverflow.com/users/6309/vonc) is a
prolific contributor to the Git topic on Stack Overflow. This edition features an
interview with him. Thanks to our [survey respondents](https://git.github.io/rev_news/2023/06/30/edition-100#some-statistics-about-the-ongoing-first-git-rev-news-readers-survey)
for suggesting to interview VonC!_

* **Who are you and what do you do?**

  By day, I am an information technology consultant working for a computer services
  company in France. By night, I am [VonC on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/6309),
  and I have contributed to various topics since its early days (Sept. 2008).
  I do that [every single day](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/122976/6309).
  It includes answering questions about Git: [almost 16K answers](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=user:6309+[git])
  in 15 years.

* **What would you name your most important contribution to Git?**

  I do not contribute to Git directly, but I report on Stack Overflow
  any interesting [git/git commits](https://github.com/git/git/commits/master)
  which provides a new answer to old questions.

  I started in 2012 with questions like "[Squash the first two commits in Git?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/598788/6309)"
  and "[How do I remove a submodule?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/16162000/6309)".
  Then [1630](https://stackoverflow.com/search?page=33&tab=Newest&pagesize=50&q=user%3a6309%20%22see%20commit%22&searchOn=3)
  commits followed over the next decade.

* **Why answering questions about Git on Stack Overflow?**

  As I mentioned in "[**How to earn a million reputation on Stack Overflow: be of service to others**](https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/10/09/how-to-earn-a-million-reputation-on-stack-overflow-be-of-service-to-others/)",
  by **[Ryan Donovan](https://twitter.com/RThorDonovan)**, this is a way to
  give back to the community, and to learn in the process.

  I learnt Git itself even before installing it, by answering a few
  questions on Stack Overflow, as I detailed in "[How'd you get started?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/367773/6309)".

* **If you could get a team of expert developers to work full-time on something in Git for a full year, what would it be?**

  I mentioned in 2013/2016 the issue of [storing large files in Git repositories](https://stackoverflow.com/a/17897705/6309).

  But nowadays, I would work on the workflow side of Git, and how to make
  it easier to use for beginners. I follow [GitButler](https://docs.gitbutler.com/)
  and [Scott Chacon](https://twitter.com/chacon)'s work.

  > GitButler is rethinking everything between when you write code in your editor of choice and when you push that code to GitHub for review.
  > Why are you making 'wip' commits when your SCM should be recording everything for you?
  > Why are everyone's commit messages close to useless?
  > Why is `git blame` the best way to get context on the code your team has written?
  > Why can't you seamlessly transition work between computers?

* **If you could remove something from Git without worrying about backward compatibility, what would it be?**

  `git checkout`! It is time. As I [explained in 2020](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58003030/what-is-the-git-restore-command-and-what-is-the-difference-between-git-restor#comment115524702_58003889),
  the `git switch`/`git restore` commands are "[experimental](https://github.com/git/git/commit/4e43b7ff1ea4b6f16b93a432b6718e9ab38749bd)"
  in name only, and are here to stay.

* **What is one of your most favorite features of Git?**

  Coming from CVS/SVN, one of my favorite features of Git is its powerful
  branching and merging capabilities. Branches in Git are lightweight and
  switching between them is fast, making it convenient to manage multiple
  streams of work simultaneously (and you have [`git worktree`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/30185564/6309)
  if you want to preserve your current working tree).

  I use those branches and merges with ["gitworkflow" (one word)](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57175304/6309),
  using long-lived integration branches (like "`master`/`main`/`release`"),
  and "ephemeral" integration branches (like "`public`/`next`/`devel`",
  created for a specific release cycle, then deleted and recreated for the
  next release cycle). See more at "[gitworkflow workflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/53405887/6309)"
  and "[Handle Git branching for test and production](https://stackoverflow.com/a/44470240/6309)".

* **What is your favorite Git-related tool/library, outside of Git itself?**

  I often used [github.com/github/gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore)
  ("**A collection of .gitignore templates**"). I have also used and promoted
  [`git filter-repo`](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo), to
  [remove large files from a Git repository](https://stackoverflow.com/a/76300821/6309).

* **Could you brief a bit about one of your most memorable experiences with Git?**

  My first `git clone`.

  As mentioned in "[How to earn a million reputation on Stack Overflow: be of service to others](https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/10/09/how-to-earn-a-million-reputation-on-stack-overflow-be-of-service-to-others/)",
  at the time I stumbled upon Git (2008/2009), I was managing big Rational
  ClearCase repositories of terabytes of data. The idea of cloning a *full* (Git)
  repository on my laptop was... incongruous, to say the least!

  I am aware of the debate around monorepo vs. multirepo (which sometimes
  goes in hand with the debate around monolith vs. microservices), but I found
  in the subsequent years that working with multiple small Git repositories was
  much more manageable than working with a single large one, as I used to do
  before, using huge [ClearCase VOBs](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/rational-clearcase/9.0.0?topic=clearcase-about-vobs-versioned-objects).

* **What is your advice for people who want to start using Git? Where and how should they start?**

  Start with understanding Git **branching**, and operations around branches
  (switch, merge, rebase, cherry-pick).

  For that, I always redirect people to "[Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org)"
  (`learngitbranching.js.org`): nothing to install, all exercises are done
  directly in the browser, and it is very visual.

  I also discourage people from blindly following the "[Git Branching Model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)",
  where an integration branch like `develop` is merged to another integration
  one like `master`. See the links above for "gitworkflow" where I explain
  why one should merge to an integration branch, not from it: merging *from*
  it means you are merging *everything* currently integrated into that branch.
  If you want to "exclude" some of those integrated commits, that becomes a
  nightmare to manage.

* **There's a common conception that "Git is confusing". What are your thoughts about the same?**

  Right... you mean [XKCD 1597, Oct. 2015, "Git"](https://explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1597:_Git).

  The level of integration of Git in IDEs (like Eclipse, IntelliJ, VSCode, ...)
  has made Git more accessible to beginners. I often redirect them to a combo
  VSCode + [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens),
  and that is enough to get them started.

  As long as the workflow is clearly defined, and the rebase is understood,
  for [managing pull request](https://stackoverflow.com/a/44672221/6309)
  (you rebase your local feature branch on top of the target branch,
  before force pushing it to the remote repository, [with lease](https://stackoverflow.com/a/52937476/6309)
  or [if-includes](https://stackoverflow.com/a/64627761/6309)), the users
  manage to get by. The bulk of my training is about the PR (Pull Request)
  workflow, which involves `git rebase` (`--onto`), and
  `git push --force-with-lease `or `--force-if-includes`.

  But clarifying *why* Git exists, and where it comes from (I have younglings
  who have no idea who [Linux Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds)
  is, and his role in the [creation of Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git#History))
  can help. Git comes with a certain vision of how a VCS should work, and
  it has a lot to do with the way the Linux kernel is developed.

* **If there’s one tip you would like to share with other users of Git, what would it be?**

  Stop using `git checkout`, start using `git switch`/`git restore` instead!

_Editor's note: We hope you enjoyed this interview. We'll explore if we could
interview other such contributors who don't directly participate in the mailing
list. If you have any suggestions, you're most welcome to share them with us through
[our issue tracker](https://github.com/git/git.github.io/issues) or by writing an
email to &lt;<kaartic.sivaraam@gmail.com>&gt;._

__Git tools and sites__

+ [dyff](https://github.com/homeport/dyff) /ˈdʏf/ is a diff tool for YAML files,
  and sometimes JSON.  Can be used as Git diff driver (see documentation).
  Written in Go, uses MIT license.
+ [Git-LaTeXdiff](https://gitlab.com/git-latexdiff/git-latexdiff) is a tool
  to graphically visualize differences between different versions of a LaTeX file.
  It is a wrapper around Git and [latexdiff](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/latexdiff)
  (which is present [on CTAN](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/latexdiff), Comprehensive TeX Archive Network).
  `git-latexdiff` is written as a BSD-licensed Bash script,
  while `latexdiff` is written in Perl (and is GPLv3-licensed).
  The git-latexdiff tool was mentioned in passing in 
  [Git Rev News Edition #8](https://git.github.io/rev_news/2015/10/14/edition-8/).
+ [git-oops](https://github.com/jvns/git-oops) is a **very experimental** tool
  allowing to undo a Git operation without having to remember the specific
  invocation, in the style of the undo features in [GitUp](https://gitup.co/), [jj](https://github.com/martinvonz/jj), and [git-branchless](https://github.com/arxanas/git-branchless).
  According to its author, it is meant as just a prototype serving
  "as inspiration for a better tool that actually works reliably"
  (see the repository README for details).  Written in Python, MIT license.
  Prior art includes:
    + One of git-oops inspirations, the [undo command in git-branchless](https://github.com/arxanas/git-branchless/wiki/Command:-git-undo),
      described in [git undo: We can do better](https://blog.waleedkhan.name/git-undo/),
