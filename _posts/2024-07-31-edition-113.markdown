### Support

* [[BUG] "git clean -df ." silently doesn't delete folders with stale .nfs* files](https://lore.kernel.org/git/ae862adb-1475-48e9-bd50-0c07dc42a520@rawbw.com/)

  Yuri reported that `git clean -df .`, which was supposed to delete a
  directory and all its contents, didn't work when there were files
  named '.nfsXXXXXXXXXXX' managed by NFS in that directory. He
  expected that `git clean -df .` would warn or error out when it
  cannot remove such a file, instead of ignoring the fact that it
  could not remove the file and the containing directory and
  terminating with a success exit code.

  Junio Hamano, the Git maintainer, replied to Yuri saying that it was
  expected that directories that were not empty were not removed.

  Yuri replied that he expected the '.nfsXXXXXXXXXXX' files to be
  removed as they were untracked, that is, neither added nor part of the repo,
  and the command was expected to remove such untracked files.

  Junio replied that the '.nfsXXXXXXXXXXX' files were "a limitation"
  of NFS that applications, including Git, couldn't and weren't
  supposed to remove. He pointed to some documentation which explains
  what these special NFS files are, and that they originate from an NFS
  protocol based implementation strategy commonly known as "silly rename".

  Yuri replied that Git should still complain when it cannot remove
  such files, or that there should be a verbosity option that should
  make it complain in such cases.

  Randall S. Becker replied to Yuri that he tried to reproduce the
  issue without using NFS and couldn't. So he asked Yuri if he could
  share "a reproducible set of commands" and said that it was probably
  caused by NFS.

  Junio replied to Randall and Yuri that removing a '.nfsXXXXXXXXXXX'
  files under a real NFSv3 client would likely result in the file
  being automatically resurrected, and that failure to remove a file
  should indeed be reported as Git does when it cannot remove a
  regular file.

  Yuri replied to Randall listing a series of instructions to
  reproduce the issue. He agreed that Git reported failures when it
  couldn't remove a file because of "permissions and special flags
  reasons", but he repeated that it should also do it in the case of
  such NFS files.

  Randall replied to Yuri saying he thought that Git didn't even see
  the NFS files. He asked if a second `git clean -df .` removed the
  NFS files and put new ones, with different names, in place.

  Yuri replied that it wasn't the case and there seemed to be a single
  NFS file.

  Chris Torek then chimed into the discussion replying to Yuri. He
  explained in details how "NFS silly renames" work, and listed some
  cases which could result in NFS lying to Git by reporting that an
  unlink(2) operation succeeded when in fact the file was renamed but
  not deleted. In such a case Git could not report that it couldn't
  remove a file. It could report that it couldn't remove the
  containing directory though.

  Chris finished his explanations saying "Anyway, that's the OS view
  of this mess. I leave the work on Git itself to others. :-)"

  Jeff King, alias Peff, replied to Yuri's email that contained a
  series of instructions to reproduce the issue. He said he got the
  following warning when trying to reproduce:
  ```
  warning: failed to remove xx/.nfs0000000002c8197f00000002: Device or resource busy
  ```

  So Peff thought Git worked properly on his system and then
  communicated details of the OS and NFS mount he used.

  Yuri replied by giving information about his system. He also said
  that when using `rm -rf` to remove the NFS file, he got a "Device or
  resource busy" error message, but not when using Git.

  Randall replied to Peff that doing a self-mount to reproduce as Peff
  did was perhaps not the best, as the NFS client might be aware of
  the self-mount and things might not behave the same as in a regular
  mount.

  Yuri suggested using a virtual machine to avoid a self-mount.

  Gabor Gombas replied to Yuri reporting the results of his tests. He
  got a "Directory not empty" or a "Device or resource busy" error
  message when he used `git clean -dfx`, but he also got no error
  message when using `git clean -df`.

  This led Yuri to reply that with `-dfx` Git indeed warns about NFS
  files on his machine, but with `-df` it doesn't, because the NFS
  files are in the ignore list.

  It is indeed expected that ignored files are not deleted and are
  just ignored without the `-x` option.


## Developer Spotlight: Rubén Justo

* Who are you and what do you do?

  My name is Rubén, and that's how it's spelled correctly.  However,
  some old friends call me Ruben because when we were kids changing
  names was a sign of friendship.  Changing the accent from "ben" to
  "ru", makes the letter 'e' lose its tilde when writing my name.

  My $dayjob is not related to Git, but I use it quite often during the
  workday.  Using it sometimes gives me an itch that I often can't
  resist trying to scratch.

* What would you name your most important contribution to Git?

  I can't think of any worth mentioning.  But I'll say something in the
  other direction;  contributing to Git has not only meant solving some
  itches, but it has clearly made me improve my overall work style.
  I'm grateful for that.

* What are you doing on the Git project these days, and why?

  This can be read at any time: polishing up some itches that has come
  up for me or a colleague.

  Lately, though, I find myself exploring more and more side issues
  that arise during iterations of the changes I was originally
  interested in.

* If you could get a team of expert developers to work full time on
  something in Git for a full year, what would it be?

  I'll say a feasible one: something _in Git_ that allows me to avoid
  writing shortcuts like `@{-1}`, `@{1}`, `@{...`

  At least on my keyboard, it's a pain to type `@`, `{...}`.  And I
  tend to type those shortcuts a lot.

  Perhaps too easy for the experts and they'll have a lot of spare time
  during the year?

* If you could remove something from Git without worrying about
  backwards compatibility, what would it be?

  I think that backwards compatibility is overrated most of the time.
  It's usually a matter of getting on with it and time;  sometimes a lot
  of time, I admit.

  The steps being taken towards Git 3.0 seem very interesting to me
  [[ref 1](https://public-inbox.org/git/xmqqa5l2y6aa.fsf_-_@gitster.g/)]
  [[ref 2](https://public-inbox.org/git/cover.1718345026.git.ps@pks.im/)].
  Perhaps there is an opportunity to do some breaking changes.  I don't
  have any in mind, though.

 * What is your favorite Git-related tool/library, outside of
   Git itself?

   Definitely: [`tig`](https://jonas.github.io/tig/).

* Do you happen to have any memorable experience w.r.t. contributing
  to the Git project? If yes, could you share it with us?

  Nope.

* What is your toolbox for interacting with the mailing list and for
  development of Git?

  To interact with the list, I mainly use [`lei`](https://people.kernel.org/monsieuricon/lore-lei-part-1-getting-started),
  [`mutt`](http://www.mutt.org/) and [`thunderbird`](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/)
  in a rather makeshift way.  Maybe someday I'll finally configure
  [`git send-email`](https://git-send-email.io/).

  In fact, more often than not, when I send a patch, I have the feeling
  that someone is going to come along and say: "Come on, Rubén.  That
  user agent?  Set up a decent environment to send this properly".

  To develop, I mainly use vanilla Vim.

* What is your advice for people who want to start Git development?
  Where and how should they start?

  Perhaps I would say that writing and reading code are not the most
  important skills in a project like Git.  Empathy and the development
  of effective arguments to convey ideas or intentions are much more
  crucial.

  Realizing and internalizing that, is a solid starting point, I think.

* If there's one tip you would like to share with other Git
  developers, what would it be?

  Keep in mind that reviewing code is much harder than writing it, but
  writing a good message for the commit is even harder.

  Summary:
  > Reality shattered like broken glass. The firmament that separated the real world from the eldritch beyond had broken. Two timelines had collided in the center of the street - an incongruous synthesis of two different chains of events. A building collapsed, and it did not. An explosion devastated the surroundings, and it did not. Screaming faces and laughs of joy overlapped each other as if viewed through a kaleidoscopic prism.
  >
  > The crowd looked on in horror and awe. Who was responsible for tearing apart the fabric of reality?
  >
  > Izuku groaned. _'Great, another merge conflict'_, he thought. _'What a pain'_.
