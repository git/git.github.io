* [Bug in merge-ort (rename detection can have collisions?)](https://public-inbox.org/git/kl6lee006mle.fsf@chooglen-macbookpro.roam.corp.google.com/)

  Glen Choo reported on the mailing list that `git merge` was failing
  on certain branches of a repo used at his workplace. As the repo is
  a public one, Glen was able to share the full recipe to reproduce the bug.

  When following it, this error appears:

  `Assertion failed: (ci->filemask == 2 || ci->filemask == 4), function apply_directory_rename_modifications, file merge-ort.c, line 2410.`

  Glen noticed that the bug seemed to be specific to the "ort" merge
  strategy, which became the default merge strategy in Git 2.34.0
  released last November.  When using the "recursive" strategy,
  which used to be the default merge strategy before "ort" took over,
  the merge seemed to work as expected.

  Glen also tried to debug the issue by himself and found that the
  reason for the assertion failure seemed to be that two files
  involved in the merge were renames of each other.

  Elijah Newren, who developed the new "ort" strategy, thanked Glen
  for the detailed report, and said that he found a small reproduction
  recipe to simplify what's going on. He explained it with the
  following sequence:

```
#   Commit O: sub1/file,                 sub2/other
#   Commit A: sub3/file,                 sub2/{other, new_add_add_file_1}
#   Commit B: sub1/{file, newfile}, sub1/sub2/{other, new_add_add_file_2}
#
#   In words:
#     A: sub1/ -> sub3/, add sub2/new_add_add_file_1
#     B: sub2/ -> sub1/sub2, add sub1/newfile, add sub1/sub2/new_add_add_file_2
```

  He noted, though, that he can also trigger a different fatal error
  in the "ort" strategy with a small tweak to the test setup, and can
  also trigger that same other fatal error in the "recursive" strategy
  with his test cases.

  He then explained that both the "ort" and "recursive" merge
  strategies have code to avoid "doubly transitive [directory]
  renames". Such renames happen when, for example, on one side of the
  merge a directory named "A" is renamed to "B", while on the other
  side "B" is renamed to "C".

  However, the code to avoid "doubly transitive [directory] renames" is
  fooled when a parent directory of a directory is renamed. For
  example if on one side a directory named "A" is renamed to "B",
  while on the other side a leading directory of "B" is renamed to
  "C".  That still wouldn't be quite enough to trigger this
  bug, though.  It also requires adding a file into directory A on one
  side and a file with the same name into directory B on the other.

  Junio Hamano, the Git maintainer, thanked Elijah for his continued
  support of the merge strategy, and noticed that at least the code was
  not "making a silent mismerge" in this special case, and that the
  recursive strategy could be used as a fallback.

  Elijah replied that he was glad the recursive strategy worked for
  Glen but noted that it didn't work with his minimal reproduction
  test case, which suggests it's less reliable as a fallback than one
  might hope.

  Glen then wondered if turning off rename detection could help in
  case of merges with complex renames like this, but Elijah pointed
  out [that might be more problematic than
  helpful](https://lore.kernel.org/git/CABPp-BGN0DoSr3bcjTmGZkcoj_dSVzOgFUQ++R=_z8v=nAJsTg@mail.gmail.com/),
  particularly since this case had a very large number of renames and
  users tend to have difficulty correctly resolving the conflicts that
  result from a lack of rename detection.  However, he suggested that
  if turning off rename detection was really wanted that one could use
  the "resolve" strategy instead, which "is roughly the recursive strategy
  minus the renames and the multiple merge base handling".

  Elijah also posted [a small patch
  series](https://lore.kernel.org/git/pull.1268.git.1655871651.gitgitgadget@gmail.com/)
  that adds test cases demonstrating the bug Glen found and the
  related ones he found based on it, and fixes the bugs in the ort
  strategy.  (The recursive strategy is deprecated, and the bugs noted
  here are not security critical.)

  Jonathan Tan reviewed the series and verified that it indeed fixes
  Glen's test case. Calvin Wan also commented on the patch series. So
  there is good hope that after a few iterations to polish the series
  the bugs will be fixed soon.
