# Google Summer of Code Wrap up: Git

[Git](http://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version-control system. We
participated in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) for the 8th time in 2015.
-->

#### Projects in 2015

##### Unification of `git for-each-ref`, `git branch` and `git tag`

**Student:** [Karthik Nayak](http://karthiknayak.github.io/),
  mentored by Christian Couder and Matthieu Moy.

With Git, branches and tags are references to a state in history.
Internally, a branch is almost the same as a tag, and both are
particular cases of the concept of references, or "ref" for short.
Still, because the use-cases are different, we had two commands with
different user-interfaces, and different implementations, plus the
command `git for-each-ref` meant to be more flexible and easier to use
in scripts.

A lot of code was moved from the user-interface part of the code to
the core library of Git, and duplicated ref-listing and formatting
code was refactored.

A nice side effect for the user is that features that were available
on one command but not another are now available everywhere. For
example, we had `git for-each-ref --format` but no `git branch
--format`, and had `git branch --contains` but not `git for-each-ref
--contains`.

The biggest contribution is of course that we reduced the code
duplication and made the code internally better.

##### Port `git am` and `git pull` from shell-script to C

**Student:** [Paul Tan](https://github.com/pyokagan), mentored by
Stefan Beller and Johannes Schindelin.

Git was initially implemented as a set of C commands for the core, and
a set of shell-script to provide a user-friendly interface. While
implementing some commands in shell allowed a quick prototyping, the
presence of shell-scripts raises a lot of issues. One is performance:
shell-scripts tend to create a lot of processes, and often manipulate
a lot of temporary files. Another one is portability, especially on
Windows.

Many Git commands written as shell-scripts were later re-written as
builtin C commands. You can still see some of the initial scripts in the
[contrib/examples](https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/contrib/examples)
directory of Git's source tree.

The second project was to port `git am` and `git pull` in C. One
difficulty is that Git has strong requirements on
backward-compatibility.

Both commands have been completely ported, and the result merged to
the master branch.

#### Retrospective

Both projects were really successful (and obviously the students
"passed" in the GSoC jargon). One thing we're happy about is that for
one project, the code is already completely reviewed and merged, and
for the other the reviewing process is almost over (and the student
remains active after the pens down date). This means that the GSoC did
not just bring us initial implementations, but solid, and
well-reviewed patches. The Git codebase is better after the GSoC than
before from the maintainability point of view.

Interestingly, both projects were essentially internal refactoring ones
(the one I mentored last year was, too). Nothing really impressive for
the end-user, but in both cases a substantial contribution to Git's
maintainability.

I'm positively surprised that students chose these topics. They are not
the best subjects to show off with your friends ("see this new command
you love so much, *I* implemented it!"), but are necessary work to make
the codebase healthier.

Not all our past experiences were success. We had failed GSoC for very
promising students, or projects that we considered as "pass" from the
GSoC point of view, but producing code that were never merged or
merged far later after substantial work from the mentor. We actually
took a break from GSoC and did not participate in 2013 because we
thought we were not good enough at mentoring and integrating students
at that time.

This year, we had long private discussions during the selection period
of the GSoC: refactoring projects like these ones have relatively high
risk. The "Wow" effect when it works is not so high, but the "Uh oh"
effect if it breaks is.

Reading the students proposals and resume is rarely sufficient to
really evaluate their skills, which makes the risk particularly hard
to evaluate. Since 2014, we've been using
[microprojects](https://git.github.io/SoC-2015-Microprojects.html) to
select students. This turned out to be very efficient, both at
identifying good (or bad) applicants, but also at giving students a
glimpse of what "contributing to Git" means. Student get an idea of
how the community is organized before starting the project.

We're now happy we took the risk. We've gained a bunch of useful
changes to Git. We've had lively discussions with students and had fun
doing it. And hopefully, these student now feel part of the community
and the fun will continue long after the GSoC :-).

### Reviews

* [refs lmdb backend](https://public-inbox.org/git/1441245313-11907-1-git-send-email-dturner%40twopensource.com/)

Last June, David Turner, who is working for Twitter, sent to the list a message titled
"[RFC/Pull Request: Refs db backend](https://public-inbox.org/git/1435020656.28466.8.camel%40twopensource.com/)"
that started with:

> I've revived and modified Ronnie Sahlberg's work on the refs db backend.

Ronnie Sahlberg, working for Google, had sent last year some emails about
[an experimental TDB backend](https://public-inbox.org/git/CAL%3DYDWn-CGZGr5bXNTiZmzr4-w_8CERx3r2bmLWbczqJ0Sn7dg%40mail.gmail.com/) and
[pluggable backends](https://public-inbox.org/git/CAL%3DYDWk5C%2BbQS76_%2Bjx1BSYSxecCxaS95RG181ecbJBLCNWLkQ%40mail.gmail.com/)
he had developed to store git refs. Unfortunately his work was too experimental and had not been merged.

This is interesting work because Git gets slower when the number of
refs in a repositories is getting really big, as its packed-refs
backend is file based and had not been designed to handle a huge
number of refs. That's why a lot of prominent Git developers, like
Jeff King, Shawn Pearce, Michael Haggerty, Stefan Beller, Duy Nguyen
and Junio Hamano were interested by David's announcement last June and
some details it contained like:

> The db backend runs git for-each-ref about 30% faster than the files
> backend with fully-packed refs on a repo with ~120k refs. It's also
> about 4x faster than using fully-unpacked refs. In addition, and
> perhaps more importantly, it avoids case-conflict issues on OS X.

One difference between Ronnie's and David's work is that David chose
LMDB instead of TDB for the new database backend. David explained that
with:

> The advantage of tdb is that it's smaller (~125k). The disadvantages are
> that tdb is hard to build on OS X.  It's also not in homebrew. So lmdb
> seemed simpler.

Since June, David, helped by many reviewers like Eric Sunshine, Johan
Herland, Michael Haggerty, Jacob Keller, Duy Nguyen, Stefan Beller,
Johannes Sixt, Philip Oakley and Junio has worked on many related
improvements, that are very helpful to advance this topic. That's why
[the last version of his patch series](https://public-inbox.org/git/1441245313-11907-1-git-send-email-dturner%40twopensource.com/)
contains the following:

> This series depends on at least the following topics in pu:
> dt/refs-bisection
> dt/refs-pseudo
> dt/reflog-tests
> kn/for-each-tag (...)

It also contains the following interesting bits:

> Also, now per-worktree refs live in the filesystem.

(...)

> As Michael Haggerty suggested, I'm now using struct ref_transaction as
> a base struct for the ref transaction structs.

This shows that David's series is using very recent improvements by
other developers in the Git codebase.

Hopefully, we can expect that, with those new ref backends, users will
be able to benefit soon from a huge amount of ground work that has
been done during the last few years.

* [t5004: test ZIP archives with many entries](https://public-inbox.org/git/20150811104056.16465.58131%40localhost/)

Johannes Schauer reported that git-archive does not use the zip64
extension and therefore is unable to properly create zip archives with
more than 16k entries.

René Scharfe agreed that there is a problem. It comes from the fact
that without the zip64 extension, the zip field for the number of
entries has only two bytes. The limit is then 65535 entries.

René then sent a patch series to add tests for this problem and then
fix it. The first patch contains the following code, which tests that
a suitable `zipinfo` command is available on the current machine, and
sets the ZIPINFO prerequesite if this is the case:

```
+ZIPINFO=zipinfo
+
+test_lazy_prereq ZIPINFO '
+	n=$("$ZIPINFO" "$TEST_DIRECTORY"/t5004/empty.zip | sed -n "2s/.* //p")
+	test "x$n" = "x0"
+'
```

Eric Sunshine replied that unfortunately the above would work neither
on MacOS X where the `zipinfo` output is different, nor on FreeBSD
where `zipinfo` has been removed in favor of `unzip -Z`.

Eric then discussed in details the possibility of using `unzip -Z`
instead of `zipinfo` to have a portable test, but it appears that this
doesn't work well on files using the zip64 extension on MacOS X and
FreeBSD .

After further discussing this, Eric, René and Junio agreed that it was
good enough that the patch and the above `zipinfo` check work on Linux
as we don't need to test the archive generated by `git archive` on
every platform.

* [git-p4: add option to store files in Git LFS on import](https://public-inbox.org/git/1440764691-62254-1-git-send-email-larsxschneider%40gmail.com/)

Lars Schneider, who is in the process of migrating huge Perforce repositories to
Git, posted a RFC (Request For Comments) patch to add an option to
git-p4 to store some big files into [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

Luke Diamand, who has been working a lot on git-p4 during the past
years, reviewed his patch saying first that it would be better to have
both a generic mechanism to handle big files and a separate Git LFS
extension rather than a specific mechanism for Git LFS. Luke also
noticed that the changes seem to require Python 3.

The discussion then focused on the merit of migrating git-p4 from
Python 2 to Python 3 until John Keeping chimed in writing:

> Documentation/CodingGuidelines currently says:
>
>  - As a minimum, we aim to be compatible with Python 2.6 and 2.7.
>
>  - Where required libraries do not restrict us to Python 2, we try to
>    also be compatible with Python 3.1 and later.

and then explaining the reason why it's difficult to migrate.

Fortunately it seems that this has not discouraged Lars to send a
[second version of his patch](https://public-inbox.org/git/1441298148-63885-5-git-send-email-larsxschneider%40gmail.com/)
that starts to address Luke's concerns and that Luke has already reviewed.

Hopefully, thanks to this ongoing work, we will soon have an easy way
to migrate Perforce repos that contains big files.

## Developer Spotlight: Eric Sunshine

Q. Who are you and how did you get involved in open-source software?

A. I'm an old-time developer who has been giving away software and
source code I've written ever since I learned to program -- before
readily-available Internet access, and long before the World Wide Web
existed. Many of my projects -- at least the ones which weren't worth
porting forward -- are as long-dead as the platforms and operating
systems for which they were written.

Q. How did your introduction to Git come about?

A. I may have seen a periodic reference to Git here and there, but
what really brought it to my attention was
[a 2007 post](http://www.cmsmadesimple.org/2007/09/13/using-git-for-core-development/) by Ted Kulp
which talked about Git's distributed nature, painless branching,
offline capability, and full local history. As a long-time RCS, CVS,
and Subversion user, I was intrigued, and decided to learn about Git,
but failed utterly. Partly this was due to Git tutorials I read being
aimed at people already at least somewhat familiar with the concept of
distributed version control, thus not really explaining it, and, as a
long-time centralized version control user, I had difficulty grasping
it. The tutorials also glossed over the Git "index", thus making it
difficult to understand its purpose or significance. Finally, Git
terminology, such as "plumbing", "porcelain", "rebasing", and "cherry
picking", which had no analog in other version control systems, or in
my general experience, seemed genuinely opaque. This situation
remained unchanged until late 2008 when I decided to try again.
Watching a video of [a Git talk](https://youtu.be/4XpnKHJAok8) at Google by Linus Torvalds,
followed by [one](https://youtu.be/8dhZ9BXQgc4) by Randal Schwartz, and reading improved tutorials
helped me finally get a grip on distributed version control and Git
itself.

Q. How did you get involved in Git project itself?

A. Once I learned and began using Git, I quickly came to appreciate
its underlying architecture, the thoughtfulness which went into its
design, and how it enabled me to create sharp, well focused commits in
a way that other VCS's had not (or actively discouraged), as well as
the ability to organize and polish history locally. Consequently, I
joined the project, not because I wanted a shiny new feature or a bug
fixed, but rather because I wanted to do my part to contribute back to
a project from which I was benefitting. My participation takes the
form of doing code reviews of submitted patches, diagnosing and fixing
bugs, and adding or enhancing a feature here and there. My hope,
particularly with the code reviews, has been to take some of the load
off the shoulders of other regular project members.

Q. What are your favorite Git features?

A. My two favorite features are (1) the ability to stage changes in
the index with precision to create sharp, well focused commits, and
(2) interactive rebase for (repeatedly) refining a series of commits
until I'm happy with the history they represent. More generally, given
Git's easy branching and built-in safety mechanisms, I appreciate the
freedom it gives me to work on many changes at once (when necessary)
without worrying about those changes clobbering one other.

Q. What is your preferred Git development model?

A. I'm partial to the mailing list approach used by the Git project
itself, since all important information -- discussions, patches, bug
reports -- are available in a centralized location (my mailbox) with
no effort on my part.  This allows for a more streamlined experience
than if I have to actively seek out the information by consulting
forums, bug trackers, and patch review websites. Moreover, the mailing
list development model allows use of email-related tools best suited
for the person and task, whereas web-based tools are often difficult
to use, feature-poor, and sometimes outright crippled. I also
appreciate the Git project's heavy emphasis well-engineered solutions,
quality commit messages, and well-organized, highly focused patches.
