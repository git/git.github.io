* [contrib/subtree: Remove --annotate](https://public-inbox.org/git/1451963101-4901-1-git-send-email-greened%40obbligato.org/)

Last January David Greene, who maintains git-subtree.sh, sent
[a patch series](https://public-inbox.org/git/1451766984-4648-1-git-send-email-greened%40obbligato.org/)
to remove the `--annotate` option from `git subtree` and then
[a version 2 of this patch series](https://public-inbox.org/git/1451963101-4901-1-git-send-email-greened%40obbligato.org/).

This came after previous work to add `--unannotate` some years ago
[in 2012](https://public-inbox.org/git/CABVa4NinSighUn7GKbzMx9qZj3Ao2dCtEZxUqCPwO9TocZ8Kkg%40mail.gmail.com/) and
[in 2013](https://public-inbox.org/git/1357646997-28675-1-git-send-email-greened%40obbligato.org/).

The reason why adding `--unannotate` has not been pursued is that it
is "difficult to define due to the numerous ways one might want to
specify how to edit commit messages". And `--annotate` is now
considered not well suited to rewriting commit messages compared to
other existing tools like `filter-branch`, `rebase -i` and
`commit --amend` that can be used afterwards.

Junio replied that the above is usually not a good enough reason to
remove a feature unless it can be shown that nobody is using it.

David then explained that he doesn't know how much `--annotate` is
used, but that he is willing to first deprecate it and then after some
time remove it.

He also explained that he is also working on a few other things "that
will involve slight semantic changes" and that he has a plan to move
`git subtree` out of the `contrib` subdirectory of the Git source tree
where it is currently and into the main area where there are all the
non contrib Git commands.

This change would possibly in the end move some of the maintenance
burden of `git subtree` from David to all the Git developers and
ultimately Junio, but David said that the changes he was planning
would remove some maintenance burden.

Junio agreed to the removal of `--annotate` and in another mail
detailed the historical purpose of the `contrib` area and what is
expected from code in this area:

> The contrib/ area was created back when Git was still young and we
> felt that it would be beneficial for building the community if
> contributions to non-core part were also included, encouraging
> developers whose strength are not necessarily in the core part to
> participate in various design-level discussions to grow the
> community faster.  Back then, we felt that an obscure standalone
> project outside Git that would help the Git-life of users have a
> much better chance of surviving (and eventually be polished) if we
> had them bundled, even if the code quality and stability were
> sub-par.
>
> Those young days are long gone.  A standalone tool that aims to help
> users' Git-life would not just survive but flourish with much more
> certainty, as long as the tool is good.  We have enough Git users to
> rely on words-of-mouth these days to ensure their success.
>
> That is why I am very hesitant to add new things to contrib/ these
> days.  It is very welcome thought that you are working on improving
> subtree, and eventually moving it out of contrib/.  From the point
> of view of the project, either moving up (to be part of the git core
> proper) or moving out (to become an independent project) is far more
> preferreable than the status quo so far that was staying in contrib/
> (without seeing much changes and slowly but steadily bitrotting).
>
> If the aspiration is to move up to exit, then the quality and
> stability expectation is basically the same as stuff in core, and we
> need to strive to keep it stable and high quality.

Recently David replied to the above:

> This is the strategy I was planning to pursue.  After extensive
> experience with git-subtree and some local enhancements I have in
> real-world work, I am convinced it is a great complementary tool to
> git-submodule.  It seems odd to me to have one in core and one not.

And David also detailled some of the work he plans to do on `git
subtree`.

### Support

* [Fwd: what is a snapshot](https://public-inbox.org/git/CAHWPVgMWeHoD5vTiFJ1gsm2hS74LK7j4npVVbOZeR43cX3qWXw%40mail.gmail.com/)

Ovatta Bianca asked:

> I read in every comparison of git vs other version control systems,
> that git does not record differences but takes "snapshots"
> I was wondering what a "snapshot" is? Does git store at every commit
> the entire files which have been modified even if only a few bytes
> were changed out of a large file?

Philip Oakley answered:

> A snaphot is like a tar or zip of all your tracked files. This means it is
> easier to determine (compared to lots of diffs) the current content.
>
> Keeping all the snapshots as separate loose items, when the majority of
> their content is unchanged would be very inefficient, so git then uses, at
> the right time, an efficient (and obviously lossless) compression technique
> to 'zip' all the snapshots together so that the final repository is
> 'packed'. The overall effect is a very efficient storage scheme.

and pointed to [some documentation on Git's web site](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain)
for "some good explanations".

Jeff King alias Peff explained how the relationship between Git
objects already makes things efficient:

> Each commit is a snapshot in that it points to the sha1 of the root
> tree, which points to the sha1 of other trees and blobs. And following
> that chain gives you the whole state of the tree, without having to care
> about other commits.
>
> And if the next commit changes only a few files, the sha1 for all the
> other files will remain unchanged, and git does not need to store them
> again. So already, before any explicit compression has happened, we get
> de-duplication of identical content from commit to commit, at the file
> and tree level.
>
> And then when a file does change, we store the whole new version, then
> delta compress it during "git gc", etc, as you describe.

And Jakub Narębski detailed the "loose" and the "packed" format.


## Developer Spotlight: Jakub Narębski

* Who are you and what do you do?

I'm an occasional contributor to Git, and an unofficial gitweb maintainer;
a physicist turned to compute science. One of first programs that I wrote
was a computer simulation. Currently I am working at the
[Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń](http://www.umk.pl/en/). There, among other things,
I teach Git to students, as a part of their coursework.

I have created, announced and analysed annual Git User's Surveys from
2007 till 2012 (all except the first one). You can find their results on the
[Git Wiki](https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitSurvey2012). This year I plan on restarting the survey.

I am also the author of the [Mastering Git](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-git) book published by Packt.

* What is your book about and why did you write it?

The goal of the "Mastering Git" book is to help readers get an expert-level
proficiency with modern Git. I wanted to pass the information about
the advanced use of Git, pass my knowledge about it,
and improve their understanding of Git behavior. The idea was
to show useful features (like for example the `git stash` command)
together with explanation on how they work, to attain a deeper understanding,
allowing Git users to be able to create their own solutions for their problems
(like for example extracting file changes from the stash),
based on this understanding of Git, instead of having to rely on ready recipes.

This book would be not created without Packt. They have found me thanks to
my contributions on StackOverflow and asked for authoring the book on Git
targeting advanced usage, to follow theirs
[Git: Version Control for Everyone](https://git-blame.blogspot.com/2013/02/git-version-control-for-everyone.html).
They were very helpful; this was my first such big work.

* How did your introduction to Git and involvement in Git project itself came about?

I have followed Git development from the very beginning of its creation, on
then existing and now defunct KernelTrap and Kernel Traffic sites (and the only
one existing issue of Git Traffic). From there I have moved to looking
on the Git mailing list. Git was so much easier to use and understand than CVS (and RCS)
that I was using then for version control: easy branching, switching branches,
merging, checking out older versions (remember sticky tags and dates?),
atomic commits, peer-to-peer workflows,...

My very first contribution to Git was an update to gitweb's README in 2006...
and that's how I came to be, a bit of time later, an unofficial gitweb
maintainer ;-)

* What would you name your most important contribution to Git?

Certainly my biggest contribution in terms of lines of code, number of commits
and number of patch reviews was my refactoring of gitweb, making it easier
to develop and maintain, while still providing a simple install path;
and providing it with a documentation
([gitweb(1)](https://git.github.io/htmldocs/gitweb.html),
[gitweb.conf(5)](https://git.github.io/htmldocs/gitweb.conf.html)). An
important to me contribution
was adding a configure script for automatic build configuration.

In terms of impact on Git's user friendliness and usability were probably
(the few) improvements to the documentation.

* What are you doing on the Git project these days, and why?

Recently, I've not been contributing much to Git.
I have now returned to the Git mailing list after a long hiatus. I am
currently working and construction and then doing Git User's Survey 2016.
The survey is preliminary planned for the month of September. Therefore
if you want to point it into specific direction, give it certain
focus, or include
a particular question, now it's time to speak. I think it is important avenue
to hear the voice of Git users, to help make Git better for all various use
cases. Also it serves as a nice way to advertise Git capabilities...

I keep reviewing gitweb patches. My TODO list for gitweb is quite long;
I hope to shorten it some.

* If you could get a team of expert developers to work full time on something in Git for a full year, what would it be?

Improving further performance on big repositories would be nice (large
number of file, large binary files, long history, large amount of branches,
tags, replacements and notes). I'd like for it to go through and borrow
ideas from other Git implementations and from other version control
systems. The addition of compressed bitmap indices first to JGit,
then to core-git to speed up cloning shows that there might be good
ideas on how to speed up reachability and least common ancestor
(also known as merge base in Git) queries in computer science papers.

One hard problem in Git that would probably need such team of experts for
a full year is resumable clone / resumable fetching. It is something that
people want to have, but it turns out it is something really hard to implement
reasonably. It can be worked around by using git bundles, which hopefully
be automated and standarized; but it is still a workaround, not a solution.

* If you could remove something from Git without worrying about backwards compatibility, what would it be?

I would make remote-tracking refs fully qualified, that is use for
example `refs/remotes/<remote>/heads/<branch>`. This would make
it easier to fetch remote-local tags, to fetch replacements, notes,
stashes, etc.

I would also redo and redesign user interface of Git commands.
The bottom-up, "worse is better" approach creates superior features,
but it all too often results in inconsistent and inferior UI. It would
be good to have consistent rules for using commands, subcommands
and options. Currently it is a bit of historical mess; some features
use command options, some subcommands. Some commands are
narrow in scope, some have many different (and weakly related)
modes of operation.

* What are your favorite Git features?

My favorite features are (1) the explicit staging area, which allows
disentangling changes to be in the next commit from the state of
the working directory, and which allows splitting commits with
an interactive rebase, and (2) reflogs, which saved me from my
mistakes in handling Git many, many times.

* What is your favorite Git-related tool/library, outside of Git itself?

Some time ago I have been using intensively a patch management tool
named [StGit](http://procode.org/stgit/) (Stacked Git). Nowadays I use interactive rebase for nearly
the same purpose, that is cleaning up a series of changes before sending
the new version upstream for the review. It is a bit more cumbersome to
use, but interactive rebase is a built in feature.

I work mostly with git core tools (with the Git itself), sometimes using
IDE integration with Git, or a graphical commit tool for easier interactive
add. As an administrator, I love [Gitolite](http://gitolite.com/) --- it allows easy creation of
repositories and repository access management, without the need to
bother sysadmins

One tool that looks interesting, and which I would like to try out,
but didn't have an occasion to use, is the [git-imerge](https://github.com/mhagger/git-imerge).
