* [Doing blobless clone by default; switching between blobless, treeless and full clones by a command](https://lore.kernel.org/git/79ed51fbd94ec2793ab0388b33963b366e48c590.camel@aegee.org/)

  Dilyan Palauzov (Дилян Палаузов) sent an email to the Git mailing
  list where he proposed making blobless cloning
  (`--filter=blob:none`) the default behavior for `git clone` via a
  global configuration option. He also suggested adding a command to
  download all locally missing history, a command to convert a
  repository to a pure treeless or pure blobless clone, and a config
  option to make blobless clone the default behavior when running just
  `git clone <URL>`.

  He said that most users used `git clone` to build or change software, not to
  immediately analyze history with commands like `git log`. Therefore,
  a reduced data download would speed up initialization, save
  bandwidth, and reduce server load.

  Kristoffer Haugsbakk replied saying the proposed command to
  "download all locally missing history" for treeless and blobless
  clones "sounds like git-backfill(1)". He also noted that he had
  "never used blob/treeless" clones himself.

  Derrick Stolee, who likes to be called just "Stolee", and who
  contributed the `git backfill` command, replied to Kristoffer
  confirming that `git backfill` is intended to assist with downloading
  the missing blobs in a blobless partial clone.

  About treeless clones though, he noted that `git backfill` is not
  optimized for them, and that treeless clones are generally not
  intended for "refilling," as downloading missing trees is
  "particularly expensive".

  Stolee suggested using `scalar clone`, which is already shipped with
  Git, instead of making blobless cloning the default, as
  `scalar clone` was contributed partly to allow users to opt into a
  version of `git clone` that incorporates "best practices and
  advanced features as they are developed", while `git clone`
  maintains backward compatibility. He recognized that `scalar clone`
  might not be "discoverable enough" though.

  Junio Hamano replied to Stolee's suggestion that a future command
  like `git big-clone` could emerge from the feedback on
  `scalar clone`. He said a separate command like `git big-clone`
  would not be discoverable enough either. Instead as a new feature
  matures, it should be a welcome change for `git clone` to borrow it
  as a new option. Such optimizations (like those for large repos)
  could be automatically enabled based on the repository's size,
  provided it was done with end-user consent.

  Patrick Steinhardt replied to Stolee about treeless clones. He
  agreed that the existing command `git backfill` is not optimized for
  refilling treeless clones, and proposed an idea to backfill trees by
  batching based on depth, but concluded that this method was
  "definitely not ideal" and would perform "way worse compared to
  backfilling blobs".

  Patrick also said that for these reasons he generally recommends not
  to use treeless clones at all.

  Stolee replied to Patrick agreeing with the general caution
  regarding treeless clones, and that they were "not a good approach
  for doing ongoing work as a human".

  However he noted that they are useful if a user needs the speed of a
  shallow clone combined with the ability to analyze commit history
  (though with no path history) for an "ephemeral scenario like a CI
  build". But they are a "tool for a very narrow case" and should only
  be used by those who understand how to avoid their pitfalls. Patrick
  then agreed with that point of view.

  Konstantin Ryabitsev, the system administrator for kernel.org,
  replied to the original email from Dilyan about making blobless
  clones the default behavior for `git clone`. He said a
  counter-rationale to this proposal was that shallow clones (which
  include blobless clones) generate significantly more load on the
  server side.

  The reason is that for these partial clones, no pre-existing packs
  are available for the operation, requiring more computation from the
  server. So changing the default behavior for `git clone` could
  likely result in slower clones for everyone and lead to more
  unavailable servers due to the high load.

  Ben Knoble also replied to Dilyan's original email by opposing the
  proposal to make blobless clones the default behavior while agreeing
  that managing this preference via a config option was a reasonable
  compromise.

  Ben's opinion was that such a default behavior would defeat the
  "tremendous advantage of distributed version control", which is about
  having the whole repository available independently. It would also
  make some of his use cases more difficult as he frequently clones
  repositories specifically to run "history spelunking searches".

  He noted that he primarily deals with repositories where the issue
  isn't about clones, but about mismanaging large binary files in
  history, which causes large blobs and clone times.

## Developer Spotlight: Toon Claes

* **Who are you and what do you do?**

  I'm Toon from Belgium. My name is pronounced like "tone" (rhymes with
  "bone"), and not like the "toon" in "cartoon", but usually I'm already
  happy if people remember my name 😉.

  I'm employed by GitLab for more than 8 years, and since late 2024 I've
  been part of the Git team, contributing to the Git project. I've started
  my professional career in 2008 building software for a payment terminal
  running embedded GNU/Linux using C & C++. Later I've transitioned into
  doing web and mobile development for a while. And now recently, I've
  been circling back to more lower-level programming, contributing to Git
  using C.

* **What would you name your most important contribution to Git?**

  I'm fairly new in the Git community, but recently I've been working on
  adding [`git last-modified`(1)](https://git.github.io/htmldocs/git-last-modified.html).
  It's a sub-command that will be released in Git v2.52. This command
  finds the commit that last modified each path in a tree. It can
  be used on forges (like GitLab, GitHub, Codeberg), to show commit
  data in a tree view.

* **What are you doing on the Git project these days, and why?**

  The subcommand [`git last-modified`(1)](https://git.github.io/htmldocs/git-last-modified.html)
  was recently merged in the 'master'. But there's more work to be
  done to improve its performance.

* **If you could get a team of expert developers to work full time on
  something in Git for a full year, what would it be?**

  Once data is committed to Git, and it's made part of the history (i.e.
  committed or merged into the default branch), it's trapped forever. This
  is a core principle of Git: you cannot rewrite history without changing
  commit hashes. This is very powerful, but also problematic in some
  scenarios.

  For example, at my $DAYJOB we receive commonly the request from
  customers to remove confidential or sensitive information from a Git
  repository. This is not possible without rewriting history. Or when, by
  accident, large files are committed to Git, you cannot get them out
  (without rewriting history). Or people might want to remove/change
  their personal information in a repository, for example when they
  transition genders.

  Can we (and should we?) build something that removes and overwrites
  pieces of history, without changing commit hashes? It's a slippery
  slope, because from experience I know Git users are very creative and
  might use this feature in ways it was not intended for.

* **If you could remove something from Git without worrying about
  backwards compatibility, what would it be?**

  The use of the double `..` and triple `...` dot notation in
  [`gitrevisions(7)`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitrevisions#_dotted_range_notations)
  and `git diff(1)`. I even once ranted about it in [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phThP8DwJVs).

* **What is your favorite Git-related tool/library, outside of
  Git itself?**

  I'm a big fan of [Magit][1]. It's arguably the best tool to interact
  with Git and I also learned a lot from it. I consider myself an
  advanced Git user, but I wouldn't be able to split up changes in
  several commits without [Magit][1].

[1]: https://magit.vc/

* **Do you happen to have any memorable experience w.r.t. contributing
  to the Git project? If yes, could you share it with us?**

  One of my earliest contributions to Git was a bug fix in the code used
  by `git bundle create`. We noticed sometimes references didn't end up in
  the bundle. After a lot of digging I submitted a patch that removed
  about 30 lines of code written way back in 2007. The code from 2007
  caused references to be skipped if they were modified while the
  `git bundle create` process was running. But it wasn't needed anymore
  due some changes made in 2013, although no one ever realized that.
  You can read more about it [in the patch][2].

  It was really satisfying to submit a patch that was nothing more than
  code deletion of really old code (and adding some tests). And it taught
  me to write a good commit message, which I was praised for by
  [the maintainer][3]. It was a very nice experience as a newcomer in the
  community.

[3]: https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqqzfl4l22t.fsf@gitster.g/

* **What is your toolbox for interacting with the mailing list and for
  development of Git?**

  I mostly live in Emacs and my terminal (zsh). I consume email in Emacs
  using [notmuch][4]. To submit patches I use [b4][5], which I also
  sometimes use to pull in patches. But I also sometimes pull in
  the branches from [Junio's fork][6] or the fork shared across
  my colleagues.

  In Git, I compile and unit test changes using Meson. Its use was
  introduced in the Git project around the [end of 2024][7]. It's
  reliable because it prevents me from forgetting to recompile
  before running tests; it's fast because it parallelizes compilation
  by default and automatically [uses Ccache][8]; it allows out-of-tree
  builds, which is really convenient if you want to benchmark various
  revisions of Git.

* **What is your advice for people who want to start Git development?
  Where and how should they start?**

  Learn to navigate [the mailing list archive][9]. It lacks structure so
  things can be hard to find, but there's so much information up there. If
  you're interested in a topic, or you think you've found the bug, start digging.
  Use [`git blame(1)`][10] to find the commit that introduced the changes
  and look up the conversation around it in the mailing list archive.
  This will help you understand why some decisions are made. Also it
  familiarizes you with the people in the community, how they think,
  how they communicate, and what's expected from you. Having the
  knowledge from those conversations can help you build a strong case
  whenever you're submitting a feature change or bug fix.

__Git tools and sites__

+ [Kinetic Merge](https://github.com/sageserpent-open/kineticMerge)
  is a command-line tool that helps you merge a heavily refactored codebase and stay sane.
  Its goals are to:
    + Merge two branches of a Git repository *holistically across the entire codebase*.
    + Take into account the motion of code in either branch due to refactoring.
    + Handle file renames, file splits, file concatenation.
    + Handle code being excised from one place in a file and moved elsewhere in that file or to somewhere within another file, or hived off all by itself in its own new file.
    + Work alongside the usual Git workflows, allowing ordinary Git merge to take over at the end if necessary.
    + Be a simple command line tool that tries to do as much as it can without supervision, and with minimal supervision when complexities are encountered.
