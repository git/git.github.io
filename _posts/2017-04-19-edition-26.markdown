## Discussions


### General

* [Will OpenSSL's license change impact us?](http://public-inbox.org/git/CACBZZX6F47uC9jLxppgkUnwVpGV2jpzzP4kwTuqKgayCevomeA@mail.gmail.com/)

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason sent an email saying that OpenSSL is
[changing its license](https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2017/03/22/license/)
to the Apache 2 license, which is
[considered incompatible with the GPL v2](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#apache2)
that Git uses for most of its code.

By default Git uses OpenSSL both for its implementation of the SHA-1
algorithm and in `git imap-send`.

Yves Orton replied by quoting the
[GPL compatibility page on the Apache web site](https://www.apache.org/licenses/GPL-compatibility.html)
which is not very clear about the incompatibilities between the Apache
2 and the different GPL versions.

Theodore Ts'o then chimed in to "suggest that we not play amateur
lawyer on the mailing list" and leave it to the distributions to
decide on their own.

Ævar agreed on that but proposed a new flag to the Makefile to declare
"yes I'm OK with combining AL2 + GPLv2".

Brian Carlson wrote "that most distros don't link against OpenSSL"
already, and suggested using
[Nettle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nettle_(cryptographic_library)),
an LGPL crypto library that also has SHA-3 which could be used to
replace SHA-1 in the long run.

But Ævar replied that we also use OpenSSL in `git imap-send` for its
TLS implementation, so it is not enough to use a different SHA-1
implementation.

About that Jeff King, alias Peff, wrote that, when building with
NO_OPENSSL, `git imap-send` uses the curl IMAP implementation instead
of our custom IMAP implementation that can optionally use
OpenSSL. Curl itself may be compiled to use either OpenSSL or GnuTLS.

### Support

* [Stable GnuPG interface, git should use libgpgme](http://public-inbox.org/git/201703101100.15214.bernhard.reiter@intevation.de)

Bernhard Reiter emailed the Git mailing list, with the gnupg-devel
mailing list in Cc, to suggest using libgpgme for interfacing to
GnuPG, instead of using "an pipe-and-exec approach to running a GnuPG
binary".

He referred to the
[documentation of the "gpg.program" config option](https://github.com/git/git/blob/3bc53220cb2dcf709f7a027a3f526befd021d858/Documentation/config.txt#L1572-L1581)
and warned that "the gpg command-line interface is not considered an
official API to GnuPG by the GnuPG-devs and thus potentially
unstable", though "Git is only using a small part of the interface, so
the risk when keeping the current way is small."

Bernhard, who is involved in GnuPG development, anyway wrote that "using
libgpgme is the way what GnuPG-devs would recommend" as can be seen on
the [GPGME API web page](https://wiki.gnupg.org/APIs).

He also reported a problem with `gpg2` vs `gpg`. He has both gpg and
gpg2 installed, but his ".gnupg" configuration file is gpg2 specific,
and Git by default uses `gpg` for signing, which fails with his
".gnupg".

Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason asked for more information about the actual
bug and the versions of gpg and gpg2 involved, hoping that it could
be possible to write patches to fix compatibility problems.

To that Michael J Gruber later replied:

> The problem is the "difficult" upgrade path and mixed installations with
> gpg and gpg2.1+ that some distributions force upon you...

and after describing possible problems:

> In short: Users will run into problems anyway; git provides the quick
> way out (git config gpg.program gpg2), users won't be as lucky with
> other things that require gpg.

Michael also wrote that "while - technically speaking - the command
line is not a stable API for gpg, it does work across versions of gpg",
though maybe this will change with gpg 2.2.

Linus Torvalds replied to Bernhard with:

> Quite frankly, I will NAK this just based on previous bad experiences
> with using "helpful" libraries.

and then explained what "the problems with libraries in this context
tend to be". For each problem: "hard to personalize", "existing
configuration", "UI" and "library versioning", he gave interesting
explanations and examples.

He concluded with:

> Of course, maybe gpgme is a world first, and actually does read your
> .gnupg/config file trivially, and has all the gpg agent integration
> that it picks up automatically, and allows various per-user
> configurations, and all my worries are bogus.
>
> But that would literally be the first time I've ever seen that.

About the "library versioning", Linus wrote:

> I don't know why, but I've never *ever* met a library developer who
> realized that libraries were all about stable APIs, and the library
> users don't want to fight different versions.

but Ted Ts'o replied to the above:

> Actually, you have.  (Raises hand :-)

and:

> I do have to agree with your general point, that most developers tend
> to be *incredibly* sloppy with their interfaces.  That being said, not
> all library developers are as bad as GNOME.  :-)

Brian Carlson also replied to Bernhard, asking "whether gpgme supports
[gpgsm](https://linux.die.net/man/1/gpgsm)", and wondering "what
happens to the git verify-* --raw output" as this output can be used
when scripting signature verification.

Brian further explained his concerns with:

> This is not an idle consideration; we have automated systems at work
> that update software automatically and submit it for human review,
> including verifying signatures and hashes. This saves hundreds of hours
> of staff time and results in better security.

The possibilities to write a wrapper script around gpg, to mimic the gpg
API, and to filter the gpg output worried him too.

Following all the above discussions Bernhard replied first to
AEvar. He gave the requested information about the versions he has
been using, and the error messages displayed when gpg accessed his
"~/.gnupg/gpg.conf" that contains gpg2-only config options.

Bernhard suggested using a "~/.gnupg/gpg.conf-2" config file, or Git
to "try `gpg2` first and then fall back to `gpg` or `gpgv` in case
only these versions are available" as workarounds, but he still thought
that it is was worth using libgpgme.

To Linus, Bernhard wrote that "it is too early to say that libgpgme
would be right choice for git", but "it should be seriously
considered", and:

> Grateful that you have written down some of your concern, let me try
> to give you some pointers.

Bernhard then replied to each of the points Linus had raised. About
"library versioning" his reply was:

> In my experience Werner (the lead GnuPG developers) is quite reasonable about
> keeping APIs stable (he often goes out of his way to keep even the command
> line version stable, maybe he shouldn't do that to the command line options
> so you are more motivated to go to this official API gpgme. >:) )

and he concluded with:

> Your concerns are understandable, I've seen similar problems with "library vs
> program" and the unix tools box approach gives a number of lessons on how to
> loosely couple components. Thanks again for taking the time and writing them
> down. I've given you some pointers why gpgme indeed could be different and
> may be an improvement for git (or other applications). I guess one of the
> next steps would be for someone to look for specific points or try gpgme for
> git purposes. Me and gnupg-devel@ are happy to take your questions or get
> feedback.

Bernhard also replied to Brian and Michael, addressing at least some
of their concerns.

But Jeff King, alias Peff, in turn replied to Bernhard, stressing that
"the existing config option will have to stay" to avoid breaking
existing "exotic" setups.

Bernhard, Michael as well as Christian Neukirchen, Peter Lebbing and
Werner Koch, the lead GnuPG developer, further discussed some points,
but in the end it doesn't look like things will change much in this
area for the foreseeable future.

## Developer Spotlight: Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason

* Who are you and what do you do?

I'm a programmer currently working at Booking.com in Amsterdam since 2010.
I've worn a lot of hats there, but most of it's had to do with
core infrastructure, I'm currently a senior dev there in an SRE role.

I'm originally from Iceland, self-taught, 31, got an 18 month old son
with my girlfriend, and a daughter on the way. My hobbies aside from
programming include power-lifting.

Unlike a lot of self-taught programmers I started relatively late.  I
had access to computers since I was a kid, but wasn't using them to
program. Mostly to play & tweak games (e.g. StarCraft map
"programming").

I eventually got tired of gaming, got a Gentoo Linux install CD from
someone. It took me around a month and a half to install it. I only
had access to some really old Mac monitor whose refresh configuration
XFree86 didn't support, so I had to go from knowing nothing at all
about Linux to debugging X bugs with intermittent Internet access
before I could start X.

I still wasn't doing any non-trivial programming, but I became a very
active editor on Wikipedia, both in Icelandic & English, and very
interested in the free software movement. I taught myself a lot of
topics by translating articles from English to Icelandic, and
eventually started running bots to update Wikipedia itself. That led
to needing to shell-script, use Perl, and eventually I started
contributing to MediaWiki itself (the software that runs Wikipedia).

Initially I mostly worked on translation-related code, mostly bugs
that hurt the Icelandic UX translation, but eventually became more
interested in the core software itself. I worked on a lot of things,
but the one most people will recognize is that I wrote the software
plugin powering the "Notes and references" section at the bottom of
pretty much every Wikipedia article.

* How did you get started in Git development?

This was back in 2010. I'd started my first software development job
at f-prot.com and become mostly inactive in MediaWiki development, but
I was very interested in source control & was involved with that at
work. I added the `git commit --allow-empty-message` feature to use in
snerp-vortex, a Subversion to Git migration script I was using to
migrate the MediaWiki repository to Git.

Shortly after that I started maintaining a mirror of the main
MediaWiki Subversion repositories on Github using `git svn`. The
MediaWiki project eventually did end up migrating to Git about a year
later, but someone else drove that effort.

* What would you name your most important contribution to Git?

Definitely adding localization support. The git command-line client is
translated to over 10 languages now. I don't use that feature myself,
I wrote it because adding translation support was a very effective way
to get to know the code-base, but hopefully that's very useful to many
users, particularly complete newbies.

Jiang Xin gets all the credit for actually maintaining and
coordinating that effort, I just drive-by added the initial support.

* What are you doing on the Git project these days, and why?

I was quite active in 2010 & 2011 but had a long period of inactivity
since then, and have only recently started submitting patches again:

```
$ git log --author=Ævar --date=format:%Y --pretty=format:%ad @{u}|sort|uniq -c
        121 2010
        152 2011
          8 2012
          1 2013
          7 2016
         29 2017
```

My main contribution for the last couple of years has been indirect.
I'm one of the two main people responsible for the Git infrastructure
at Booking.com (along with Dennis Kaarsemaker, interviewed in a
[previous iteration of Git Rev News](https://git.github.io/rev_news/2016/10/19/edition-20/)).

In late 2015 I made the case internally at Booking.com that we should
contribute time directly to Git development, which we're doing by
contracting Git performance to Christian Couder, who's maintaining
this newsletter & doing this interview, and no I didn't put him up to
interviewing me :)

I manage that project at Booking.com, which mainly consists of
occasionally touching base with Christian on what performance-related
thing he and I think is worthwhile to do next.

Then I send the occasional patches myself, mainly small isolated
things to scratch this or that itch I personally run into, or that
someone reports as a bothersome misfeature or bug at work.

But to actually answer the question: Right now I have a series in the
works to support PCRE v2, some other related fixes to `git grep`, and a
couple of miscellaneous code cleanup submissions I need to pick up
again.

* If you could get a team of expert developers to work full time on
  something in Git for a full year, what would it be?

The Git data model is so much more flexible in theory than any of the
Git clients out there allow for.

Microsoft's made the first real step to advancing that with
[GVFS](https://github.com/Microsoft/GVFS). I'd have my hypothetical team
work on something like that, but on steroids.

I.e. a git client/server pair that could trade off as much work
between the client & server as you wanted, and which could scale to
cloning & working on something like the result of `git merge`-ing
every single repository on GitHub into one ginormous project, with
every command that needed to walk/search/checkout a large part of that
set able to either download the data it needed locally or ask a server
to produce the results it needed.

* If you could remove something from Git without worrying about backwards compatibility, what would it be?

Right now support for anything except PCRE regular expressions, but
that's just because right now I'm hacking in PCRE v2 support to grep
and supporting POSIX regexes going forward for some of the things I'd
like to do is a pain.

More generally, more than deprecating any one thing I think Git could
really use deprecation cycles as part of its release process. I.e. we
should make an exhaustive list of things we have now which suck, then
at some point we break all of those, release v3.0, and start the
process again by accumulating things we'll break in v4.0.

* What is your favorite Git-related tool/library, outside of Git itself?

The git-rebase.el plugin for Emacs, which is the the only non-core Git
interface I use which I'd miss enough to personally write a
replacement for myself if it didn't exist.

It's sort of like a little `git add --interactive`, except for `git rebase`,
which of course has an --interactive option already, but
which isn't very interactive at all. It would be neat to add something
like git-rebase.el to Git itself, but we'd have to call it
`git rebase --actually-interactive`, which I brings us back to the backwards
compatibility discussion.
