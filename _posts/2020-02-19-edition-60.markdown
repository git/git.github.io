## Git Rev News: Edition 60 (February 19th, 2020)

Welcome to the 60th edition of [Git Rev News](https://git.github.io/rev_news/rev_news/),
a digest of all things Git. For our goals, the archives, the way we work, and how to contribute or to

This edition covers what happened during the month of January 2020.

## The Pros and Cons of Reposurgeon (*written by [Eric S. Raymond](http://www.catb.org/~esr/)*)

On January 12th 2020, the history of the GNU Compiler Collection was
lifted from Subversion to Git. At 280K commits, with a history
containing traces of two previous version-control systems (CVS and
RCS) this was the largest and most complex repository conversion of an
open-source project ever. It swamped the previous record-holder --
Emacs's move from Bazaar to Git back in 2011 -- by an order of magnitude.

Both those conversions were done by [reposurgeon](https://gitlab.com/esr/reposurgeon).
Neither of them could practically have been performed by any other
conversion tool available. This article will explain why that is, and
under what circumstances you might consider using reposurgeon
yourself.

Let's start with a brief description of what reposurgeon actually
does. When you use it, you start by reading in a version-control
repository... but actually, that's not quite right. What reposurgeon
actually does is read in a git fast-import stream. It looks like it
reads repositories because it knows how to call front ends that use
exporters such as git-fast-export and cvs-fast-export to serialize a
repository for it.

Actually, that's not quite right either. Subversion doesn't have an
exporter -- there is no svn-fast-export (well, not one that works for
more than trivial cases, anyway). Instead, reposurgeon reads the
native serialization produced by Subversion's svnadmin dump
tool. Internally, this is massaged into the equivalent of a git
fast-import stream and represented as one inside reposurgeon.

There are reposurgeon-compatible exporters for RCS, CVS, bzr, hg, SRC,
bk, and of course git itself. With a little extra work using sccs2rcs
it's possible to reach all the way back to collections of SCCS files.

Now that you've caught your repository, what can you do with it?

I observed earlier that what you have, internally, is a deserialized
version of a git fast-input stream. A productive way to think about
what reposurgeon does is to remember that this is basically just a DAG
(directed acyclic graph) with text attached to the nodes. Now think of
reposurgeon as an editor for this graph and its nodes. Then, think of
it as a DSL (domain-specific language) designed to be *scripted* --
that is, designed to reproducibly apply editing procedures to this
graph.

So the general answer to "what can you do with it" is "anything you
want to". I enjoy thinking about and implementing DSLs, and once I had
the basic design idea it was pretty much inevitable that I was going
to write the most general set of primitives I could imagine -- and I
have a very fertile imagination.

Elijah Newren's aside on reposurgeon in [Git Rev News 54](https://git.github.io/rev_news/2019/08/21/edition-54/)
described it as “GDB for history rewriting”. That's a pretty good
analogy, actually. Better than even I knew until recently, because it
turns out the Python Cmd library I originally used to write its
command interpreter was designed to emulate the interface style of gdb
and earlier symbolic debuggers.

Accordingly, you can immediately use reposurgeon for a lot of
relatively simple tasks like (1) removing extremely bulky content that
shouldn't have been checked in, (2) partitioning and merging
repositories, (3) transcoding Latin-1 metadata to UTF-8, (4)
debubbling an unnecessary complex history to make reading it easier.

Often, though, those things can be done with other tools like his
git-filter-repo. It's repository conversions for which you are likely
to actually *need* the full power of a domain-specific language
designed for repository surgery.

Which brings us to how you write out your graph as a live
repository. Reposurgeon doesn't do that directly either. When it needs
to write out a repository, it hands a git fast-import stream to an
importer back end. That could be git fast-import itself, or the
corresponding importers for hg, bzr, darcs, bk, RCS, or SRC.

Here's what reading in and immediately converting a small Subversion
dump would look like:

```shell
$ reposurgeon
reposurgeon% read <foo.svn
23 svn revisions (0K/s)
* foo
reposurgeon% prefer git
git is the preferred type.
reposurgeon% rebuild bar
reposurgeon: rebuild is complete.
reposurgeon: no preservations.
reposurgeon% 
```

In theory you now have a Git repository named "bar" in your current
directory that is a perfect translation of foo. In practice, for any
nontrivial repository, you probably have a bit of a mess on your
hands.

If you had read in any Git repository and written it out again, you'd
get a perfect copy. But when you're moving histories between
*different* version-control systems, you have to deal with the
mismatch between the source system's model of version control and the
target's.

A good example of this is the fact that Subversion doesn't have
anything directly corresponding to a Git tag. A Subversion tag is
actually a directory copy operation with a target under the tags/
directory. The copy operation leaves a commit in place which, if moved
literally to gitspace, would just be junk. What you want is to move
the metadata of that commit to an annotated tag.

Many attempts at importers silently botch this in practice, but it can
be handled automatically in theory -- and reposurgeon does that. The
mess you're likely to have on your hands anyway is due to Subversion
operator errors, scar tissue for a previous conversion out of CVS, and
use of git-svn as a live gateway to the repository.

The most common symptom of all these error sources is misplaced branch
joins; in extreme cases you may even have disconnected
branches. Reposurgeon enables you audit for and repair this kind of
defect. Here are a few examples of that kind of repair done on the GCC
repository:

```
# /branches/GC_5_0_ALPHA_1
<27855>|<27860> reparent --use-order
# /branches/apple-200511-release-branch
<105446>|<105574> reparent --use-order
# /branches/apple-gcc_os_35-branch
<90334>|<90607> reparent --use-order
# /branches/apple-tiger-release-branch
<96593>|<96595> reparent --use-order
```

The GCC conversion was pretty hairy -- 343 lines of DSL scripting -- but
there are whole new levels of complexity when, as still sometimes
happens, you need to recover history from pre-version-controlled
sources to stitch the repository together.

In [one extreme case](http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=2491), I ended up
stitching together material from 18 different release tarballs, 11
unreleased snapshot tarballs, one release tarball I could reconstruct,
one release tarball mined out of an obsolete Red Hat source RPM, two
shar archives, a pax archive, five published patches, two zip files, a
darcs archive, and a partial RCS history,

But reposurgeon can handle this, because it make conversion
experiments easy. The workflow it's designed for is carefully building
a script that assembles your source repository and other data into a
simulacrum of what a Git repository tracking your project from the
beginning of time would have looked like.

Almost never will you get this right the first time. It takes testing,
polishing, tripping over assumptions you didn't know you and your
tools were making, and correcting for those assumptions. In the GCC
case it took many hours of work to locate and develop fixes for the
misplaced branch joins.

A subtle but important point is that I didn't do that work
myself. That kind of thing is not a job for reposurgeon's maintainer,
it's a job for a "Mr. Inside" who knows the project's history
intimately -- in this case it was actually the GCC project lead, Joseph
Myers. One of reposurgeon's requirements is that it has to be a tool
that a "Mr. Inside" can learn to use with minimum friction.

And generally it is, if you're being driven to it by the kind of
problem it was designed to solve -- it's like gdb that way. I've been
taken to task about the tool having no intro documentation; this is
not because I'm lazy, it's because there's
[no plausible way to write any](http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8551), any
more than there is for gdb. You're ready to learn reposurgeon, as
Joseph Myers did, when you're stuck into a conversion or editing
problem so deep that the *very* complete
[reposurgeon command reference](http://www.catb.org/~esr/reposurgeon/reposurgeon.html)
starts to make sense to you.

* [Broken branch after git commit](https://lore.kernel.org/git/07c84224bb0b093ab3770be9b5ab2ec23ce2d31a.camel@gmail.com/)

  Torsten Krah wrote that after using `git restore --staged $my-files`
  to remove some files from the index, but not the working tree, and
  then `git commit` to commit other changes, he found that the files
  were marked as deleted in the index though they are still in the
  working tree.

  He didn't understand what happened and didn't know how to fix the
  situation. He later added that the `git commit` he had done had
  actually committed the files even though `git status` told him that
  the files wouldn't go into the commit. And he also sent instructions
  to help reproduce the issue.

  Jeff King, alias Peff, replied to Torsten saying that he couldn't
  reproduce the issue and asking for more details and examples.

  Torsten then sent an example with a lot more details which enabled
  Peff to reproduce the issue. Peff confirmed that there was a bug in
  `git restore` and also found that the index-reading code could
  segfault when it processes bogus cache-trees.

  Peff also mentioned that Emily Shaffer had recently found a similar
  segfault and that she had provided [a fix](https://lore.kernel.org/git/20200108023127.219429-1-emilyshaffer@google.com/),
  and then came up with [a patch](https://lore.kernel.org/git/20200108114344.GA3380580@coredump.intra.peff.net/)
  to fix the bug in `git restore --staged`.

  Junio Hamano, the Git maintainer, reviewed the patch and praised Peff,
  while Dennis Kaarsemaker reported just being bitten by seemingly the
  same bug.

  In the meantime Torsten also thanked Peff for investigating the
  issue and asked for a way to fix his current index. Peff suggested
  using `git reset --hard <original-commit>` after finding the
  original commit in the reflog. Torsten replied that he actually had
  to remove the index using `rm .git/index` first to get back to a
  working state.

## Developer Spotlight: Chris Webster
* Who are you and what do you do?

  I am a retired software developer. After 25+ years in commercial
  software development I wanted to contribute to open source.
  Having used GNU Make and Perl extensively in a build system
  I wanted to give back. GitGitGadget caught my attention when
  I was contributing a fix to diff-highlight.pm in Git.
  Dscho guided me through my many errors to get the change
  approved. I decided to help with GitGitGadget to say thanks.
  Fun/scary facts: Primary language -- IBM mainframe assembler,
  Secondary language: C++.

* What would you name your most important contribution to Git?

  My contributions are mainly to GitGitGadget and I think adding
  the `/preview` command was really helpful. It only gets used
  once by most new contributors to Git but it gives them a chance
  to see what their change requests would look like. I hope seeing
  the email gives these contributors the confidence to submit their
  changes to the general Git community. It wasn't a big change but
  it appears to get used by a lot of first time contributors.

* What are you doing on the Git ecosystem these days, and why?

  I am still very much in learning mode. Working on GitGitGadget
  provides an opportunity to work with modern TypeScript and
  JavaScript features. There are some issues I would still like
  to help with. Contributing more to Git is a next step.
  Helping to make tools easier and more reliable is my motivation.

* Can you briefly explain your user experience with Git so far?

  So far I have been mostly using Git from the command line and
  only recently started to look at Git-GUI and gitk. This is a
  stark contrast to my previous use of CM/Synergy and PVCS
  where the GUI was used almost exclusively. Working on GitGitGadget
  requires getting to know some of the plumbing of Git and GitHub,
  which is interesting. For personal projects, most use is pretty basic.

* Have you ever felt that something that you've used in other version
  control software is missing from Git?

  VS Code shows a side-by-side diff for working objects. CM/Synergy
  allowed a side-by-side diff for any versions of the objects. I have
  not seen a way to do that. Sometimes it is easier to debug when you
  have the complete source to see changes.

  ***Note**: Chris was told that `git difftool` might help him with getting
  side-by-side diff in Git. He acknowledged the same stating "Difftool looks
  like what I am looking for".*

* What is your favorite Git-related tool/library, outside of Git itself?

  My answer should be GitGitGadget but I'm not really a user these
  days -- need to be more of a contributor to Git to appreciate GitGitGadget.
  VS Code is providing more Git specific tooling (i.e. Timeline view) that
  looks really interesting along with the GitLens extension.
