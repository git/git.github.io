* [Junio's blog](http://git-blame.blogspot.com/)
* Company blogs of [GitHub](https://github.com/blog), [BitBucket](https://blog.bitbucket.org/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/), etc.
* ...

## Forums/news

# Process

For every upcoming edition, do the following:

* Create a new edition-[number].md file in some draft directory.
* Post a mail/thread to the Git dev list asking if
  there's anything anyone wants included in the upcoming edition.
* Post an issue in this GitHub repository asking for
  comments/contributions - anyone can comment on this, or send pull-
  requests for editing the edition.md file.
* When the time comes to release the edition, move the edition.md file
  into some designated publishing directory, so it appears in
  the feed on git.github.io/rev_news/.
* Announce the edition to the Git mailing list plus any social media channels you prefer.
* Send the newsletter email (manual process using Mailchimp) - basically just copying the edition into MailChimp for publishing. Christian, Markus and Thomas should have account access.

Links can be handily collected using a browser extension like [diigo](https://www.diigo.com/user/Tfnico/gitrevnews), but note that popular may be duplicated by other contributors.

When adding links, this is a great tool: [chitsaou/copy-as-markdown](https://github.com/chitsaou/copy-as-markdown/)
