# About Git Rev News

We created this news source for the following reasons:

## Promote reviewers and helpers

The main goal of Git Rev News would be to promote the work of people
reviewing patches and doing user support on the Git mailing list.

Note that as there can be a lot of traffic on the Git mailing list and
as people writing Git Rev News would probably work on it on their free
time, readers should not expect all the Git reviews and support to be
covered.

## Help people learn about Git development

By reading Git Rev News people could learn about Git developement and
become interested in participating in it.

## Propagate misc Git news

A lot of interesting things around Git happen outside the Git mailing
list and might be worth propagating to show how vibrant the Git
community and its ecosystem are.

Also Git developers might have some personnal (like getting maried,
having a child, ...) or professional (looking for a Git related job or
freelance mission) information they want to share.

## Why the name Git Rev News?

"Rev" can be understood both as an abbreviation of "revision" and as
an abbreviation of "reviews". It is probably better to have a name
that is not too tied to a particular schedule or a particular kind of
news.

## Who would write or contribute to it?

A few editors would be expected to write most of it, especially the
parts about reviews and support. But everyone would be welcome to
contribute using pull requests.

The news letter would be prepared on [GitHub](https://github.com/git/git.github.io)
and published on [git.github.io](https://git.github.io) and perhaps elsewhere too.
